Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry for the determination of elements and elemental species in food: a review.,"Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has definitely emerged as a powerful technique for total element determination and as a sensitive and selective detector in hyphenated methods for speciation analyses of elements in foods. In this review, the analytical challenges of elemental analysis of food and agricultural matrixes are discussed and several applications are examined. Selected examples illustrate the analytical approaches being used so far to address specific issues in various areas of food and nutrition research. The applications discussed include studies on dietary intake, element metabolism in man, transfer of elements through the food chain, effects of food processing and domestic preparation, and authenticity and origin assessment. The use of ICP-MS in the field of analytical quality assurance, food control, evaluation of food contact materials, and radionuclide contamination is also examined. Finally, the hyphenated techniques with ICP-MS detection used for elemental speciation in food are reviewed, and an overview of the main applications currently in the literature is presented. Throughout, recent trends and analytical developments likely to have a major impact on food-related areas are highlighted.",p
Sentiment Classification of Food Reviews,"  Sentiment analysis of reviews is a popular task in natural language
processing. In this work, the goal is to predict the score of food reviews on a
scale of 1 to 5 with two recurrent neural networks that are carefully tuned. As
for baseline, we train a simple RNN for classification. Then we extend the
baseline to GRU. In addition, we present two different methods to deal with
highly skewed data, which is a common problem for reviews. Models are evaluated
using accuracies.

"Properties of low-fat, low-cholesterol egg yolk prepared by supercritical CO2 extraction.","A dry egg yolk ingredient called Eggcellent has 74% less fat and 90% less cholesterol than liquid egg yolks, when reconstituted on an equal protein basis. The phospholipids and proteins are retained, enabling the ingredient to have the taste and texturizing properties of fresh egg yolk. Using the new yolk, it is possible to significantly improve the acceptability of low-fat, low-cholesterol bakery products, scrambled eggs and mayonnaise dressings without losing nutritional claims. The structures and functional properties of egg yolk components and the conditions required to optimize their benefits in foods are reviewed. The lipoproteins of low-fat, low-cholesterol yolk have valuable properties as flavorants, texturizers, foaming agents, emulsifiers, antioxidants, colorants, and nutraceuticals.",p
Lectins in the United States diet: a survey of lectins in commonly consumed foods and a review of the literature.,"Plant lectins or phytohemagglutinins possess potent in vivo biological activities. Some, primarily of the family Leguminosae, have been shown to have deleterious nutritional effects. Little information exists, however, regarding the prevalence of lectins or the specific foods that contain lectins in the United States diet. In the present study the edible parts of 29 of 88 foods tested, including common salad ingredients, fresh fruits, roasted nuts, and processed cereals were found to possess significant lectin-like activity as assessed by hemagglutination and bacterial agglutination assays. Based on this survey and a review of the literature we conclude that dietary exposure to plant lectins is widespread. The spectrum of nutritional consequences of such exposure remains to be determined.",p
The migration from the internal coatings of food cans; summary of the findings and call for more effective regulation of polymers in contact with foods: a review.,"The analysis of migrates from the internal coatings of food cans showed that the present regulation is not sufficient to ensure safety of food contact polymers. The migrates often consist of complex mixtures of reaction products and impurities, and their harmlessness cannot be deduced from the use of non-toxic starting substances compiled in positive lists. The regulation proposed herein asks producers to analyse the composition of the migrates. It includes an upper limit for the molecular weight (e.g. 1000 Da) and thresholds defining concentrations in the foods down to which components must be identified and evaluated. Primarily considering feasibility at reasonable costs, thresholds of 30 micrograms/kg for individual components and 300 micrograms/kg for the sum of the unidentified materials are proposed. Producers must be able to demonstrate that the individual components or mixtures exceeding this limit, including reaction products with food components, have no toxic effect.",p
Listeriosis and its transmission by food.,"Investigations of recent outbreaks and sporadic cases of listeriosis in North America and other countries have shown that the infection can be foodborne. Pregnant women and their fetuses, the elderly, and immuno-compromised individuals are at increased risk of listeriosis. Listeria monocytogenes, the causative bacterium, is widespread in nature and is found in many foods. It can grow at refrigerator temperatures and is resistant to adverse conditions and to several antibiotics. The generally low levels of the organism found in foods require procedures to optimize their detection and recovery. Occurrence and characteristics of the bacterium, virulence and disease symptoms, transmission to humans, incidence and behavior in foods, and means of controlling growth in foods are reviewed.",p
Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry in food analysis.,"This work provides an updated overview (including works published till June 2004) on the principal applications of capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) together with their main advantages and drawbacks in food science. Thus, analysis of amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, or polyphenols by CE-MS in different foods is reviewed. Also, other natural compounds (e.g., alkaloids) and toxins analyzed by CE-MS in foods are revised. Moreover, exogenous substances with a potential risk for human health (e.g., pesticides, drugs) detected in foods by CE-MS are included in this work. The usefulness of CE-MS for food analysis and the information that this coupling can provide in terms of processing, composition, authenticity, quality, or safety of foods is also discussed.",p
Pulsed electric field processing of foods: a review.,"Use of pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for inactivation of microorganisms is one of the more promising nonthermal processing methods. Inactivation of microorganisms exposed to high-voltage PEFs is related to the electromechanical instability of the cell membrane. Electric field strength and treatment time are the two most important factors involved in PEF processing. Encouraging results are reported at the laboratory level, but scaling up to the industrial level escalates the cost of the command charging power supply and of the high-speed electrical switch. In this paper, we critically review the results of earlier experimental studies on PEFs and we suggest the future work that is required in this field. Inactivation tests in viscous foods and in liquid food containing particulates must be conducted. A successful continuous PEF processing system for industrial applications has yet to be designed. The high initial cost of setting up the PEF processing system is the major obstacle confronting those who would encourage the system's industrial application. Innovative developments in high-voltage pulse technology will reduce the cost of pulse generation and will make PEF processing competitive with thermal-processing methods.",p
Occurrence of nitroso compounds in fungi-contaminated foods: a review.,"Dimethylnitrosamine (NDMA), diethylnitrosamine (NDEA), methylbenzylnitrosamine, and a new N-nitroso compound, N-3-methylbutyl-N-1-methylacetonylnitrosamine (NMAMBA), were found in cornbread that was inoculated with Fusarium moniliforme and underwent an incubation and the addition of a small amount of NaNO2. The carcinogenicity of NMAMBA was shown by the induction of forestomach carcinomas and liver tumors in mice and rats. Another new nitrosamine, N-2-methylpropyl-N-methylacetonyl nitrosamine, was isolated in millet and wheat flour after similar treatment. Some species of fungi not only can reduce nitrates to nitrites but also can increase the amount of secondary amines in the moldy foods and provide favorable conditions for the synthesis of nitrosamines. Some fungi may utilize primary amines to synthesize nitrosamines in appropriate culture mediums. Furthermore, the cornmeal may naturally contain trace amounts of nitrosamines, as detected by a gas chromatography/thermoenergy analyzer. Prolonged feeding of F. moniliforme-inoculated cornbread alone also induced the development of forestomach carcinoma in rats. This indicates the occurrence of potential carcinogens, perhaps certain Fusarium mycotoxins, in the moldy cornbread in addition to the carcinogenic nitrosamines. Another nitroso compound, Roussin red methylester (di-mu-methanethiolatotetranitrosodiiron) was found in pickled vegetables that are eaten daily in the Linxian (China) area. Roussin Red may provide NO-2 ions, which would react readily with secondary amines to form nitrosamines. Possibly this compound is a natural tumor promoter and is able to induce epithelial hyperplasia of the upper digestive tract and forestomach papilloma in treated mice. Also, trace amounts of NDMA, NDEA, and some other nitrosamines were found in the extract of pickled vegetables.",p
Tin in canned food: a review and understanding of occurrence and effect.,"Tinplate is light gauge, steel sheet or strip, coated on both sides with commercially pure tin and has been used for well over a hundred years as a robust form of food packaging. Altogether, about 25,000 million food cans are produced and filled in Europe per annum, about 20% of these having plain internal (unlacquered) tin-coated steel bodies. Worldwide, the total for food packaging is approximately 80,000 million cans. Tinplate is also extensively used for the production of beverage cans. Europe produces and fills over 15,000 million tinplate beverage cans per annum all of which are internally lacquered. The use of tinplate for food and beverage packaging, will result in some tin dissolving into the food content, particularly when plain uncoated internal surfaces are used. The Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake for tin is 14 mg/kg body weight and recommended maximum permissible levels of tin in food are typically 250 mg/kg (200 mg/kg UK) for solid foods and 150 mg/kg for beverages. However, the question arises as to whether evidence exists that such elevated levels of tin in food in any way constitute a risk to human health. This review considers the factors affecting the dissolution of tin, the reported measurements/surveys of actual levels of tin in canned foods and the studies and reports of acute (short term) toxicity relating to the ingestion of elevated levels of tin in food products. Chronic studies are mentioned, but are not covered in detail, since the review is mainly concerned with possible effects from the ingestion of single high doses. From published data, there appears to be a small amount of evidence suggesting that consumption of food or beverages containing tin at concentrations at or below 200 ppm has caused adverse gastrointestinal effects in an unknown but possibly small proportion of those exposed. However, the evidence supporting this assertion is derived from reports of adverse effects which offer data that are limited, incomplete or of uncertain veracity. Clinical studies provide greater confidence regarding the effects of exposure concentration and dose, but few relevant studies have been made. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were observed in limited clinical studies at concentrations of 700 ppm or above, although no adverse gastrointestinal effects were also reported in two studies at higher concentrations. Overall, therefore, the published data do not present a particularly comprehensive profile on the toxic hazard to man of acute exposure to divalent inorganic tin. A food survey suggested that the contents of almost 4% of plain internal tinplate food cans contain over 150 mg/kg of tin and over 2.5 million such cans are consumed every year in the UK alone. Despite this, in the last 25 years, there have been no reports of acute effects attributable to tin contamination in the range 100-200 ppm. These facts strongly suggest that there is little evidence for an association between the consumption of food containing tin at concentrations up to 200 ppm and significant acute adverse gastrointestinal effects. Clearly though, only further clinical studies will generate unequivocal evidence that current legislative limits provide safe levels for adults in the general population.",p
Modulation of globular protein functionality by weakly interacting cosolvents.,"Globular proteins are utilized in food, pharmaceutical, and health-care products because of their unique functional attributes, for example, enzyme catalysis, ligand binding and transport, surface activity and self-association. The expression of these functional attributes in a particular product depends on the molecular structure, chemical environment and thermal-mechanical history of the proteins. The optimization of the design and operation of processing technologies used to manufacture protein-containing materials depends on a thorough understanding of the influence of processing conditions and material composition on protein properties. This paper focuses on the impact of weakly interacting neutral cosolvents (such as sugars and polyols) on the structural, thermodynamic and functional properties of globular proteins in foods. The physicochemical mechanisms by which these cosolvents can modulate protein functionality are highlighted, that is, differential interactions and steric exclusion. Previous studies of the impact of cosolvents on protein functionality that are relevant to foods are reviewed, for example, water solubility, stabilization, emulsification, foaming, gelation, enzyme catalysis, and flavor binding.",p
"Carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in model systems and cooked foods: a review on formation, occurrence and intake.","Frying or grilling of meat and fish products may generate low ppb levels of mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HAs). Many heterocyclic amines are formed via the Maillard reaction from creatine, free amino acids and monosaccharides; compounds naturally occurring in protein-rich foods of animal origin. The formation and yield of HAs are dependent on physical parameters, such as cooking temperature and time, cooking technique and equipment, heat and mass transport, and on chemical parameters, especially the precursors to HAs. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the formation of HAs in cooked foods and model systems, and summarizes data on the content of HAs in various cooked foods, and estimates of the dietary intake of HAs. It should be noted that the presence of carcinogens of other types in food (e.g. nitrosamines, aromatic amines, cholesterol oxide products) and that their generation during frying and grilling are outside the scope of this review.",p
Assessment of the food safety issues related to genetically modified foods.,"International consensus has been reached on the principles regarding evaluation of the food safety of genetically modified plants. The concept of substantial equivalence has been developed as part of a safety evaluation framework, based on the idea that existing foods can serve as a basis for comparing the properties of genetically modified foods with the appropriate counterpart. Application of the concept is not a safety assessment per se, but helps to identify similarities and differences between the existing food and the new product, which are then subject to further toxicological investigation. Substantial equivalence is a starting point in the safety evaluation, rather than an endpoint of the assessment. Consensus on practical application of the principle should be further elaborated. Experiences with the safety testing of newly inserted proteins and of whole genetically modified foods are reviewed, and limitations of current test methodologies are discussed. The development and validation of new profiling methods such as DNA microarray technology, proteomics, and metabolomics for the identification and characterization of unintended effects, which may occur as a result of the genetic modification, is recommended. The assessment of the allergenicity of newly inserted proteins and of marker genes is discussed. An issue that will gain importance in the near future is that of post-marketing surveillance of the foods derived from genetically modified crops. It is concluded, among others that, that application of the principle of substantial equivalence has proven adequate, and that no alternative adequate safety assessment strategies are available.",p
Methods for allergen analysis in food: a review.,"Food allergies represent an important health problem in industrialized countries. Undeclared allergens as contaminants in food products pose a major risk for sensitized persons. A proposal to amend the European Food Labelling Directive requires that all ingredients intentionally added to food products will have to be included on the label. Reliable detection and quantification methods for food allergens are necessary to ensure compliance with food labelling and to improve consumer protection. Methods available so far are based on protein or DNA detection. This review presents an up-to-date picture of the characteristics of the major food allergens and collects published methods for the determination of food allergens or the presence of potentially allergenic constituents in food products. A summary of the current availability of commercial allergen detection kits is given. One part of the paper describes various methods that have been generally employed in the detection of allergens in food; their advantages and drawbacks are discussed in brief. The main part of this review, however, focuses on specific food allergens and appropriate methods for their detection in food products. Special emphasis is given to allergenic foods explicitly mentioned in the Amendment to the European Food Labelling Directive that pose a potential risk for allergic individuals, namely celery, cereals containing gluten (including wheat, rye and barley) crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, milk and dairy products, mustard, tree-nuts, sesame seeds, and sulphite at concentrations of at least 10 mg kg(-1). Sulphites, however, are not discussed.",p
Weaning foods: a review of the Indian experience.,"Although breastmilk is adequate to meet the energy and nutrient requirements of an infant up to four to six months of age, thereafter it is insufficient to sustain normal growth and needs to be supplemented with other foods, such as weaning foods. However, the capacity of a weaning diet to meet the protein and energy requirements of infants depends on its nutritional quality as well as its dietary bulk. This review highlights varieties of weaning foods, blend formulations, nutrient requirements, process characteristics, physicochemical parameters, quality evaluation, and other important aspects of developing a weaning food that satisfies all the requirements of the infant during the vulnerable transitional stage. Traditional weaning foods of India are briefly summarized.",p
Chromatographic determination of carotenoids in foods.,"In recent years, there has been particular emphasis on obtaining more accurate data on the types and concentrations of carotenoids in foods for various health and nutrition activities. The analysis of carotenoids is complicated because of the diversity and the presence of cis-trans isomeric forms of this group of compounds. In addition, a wide variety of food products of vegetal and animal origin, vegetables and animal samples contain carotenoids, and a great range of carotenoids can be found in these samples. The characteristic conjugated double bond system of carotenoids produces the main problem associated with work and manipulation on carotenoids, that is their particular instability, especially towards light, heat, oxygen and acids. For this reason, several precautions are necessary when handling carotenoids. Another problem associated with analysis of carotenoids is the difficulty in obtaining standard compounds. High-performance liquid chromatographic methods for the determination of carotenoids in foods are reviewed. The sample extraction and treatment, carotenoid purification and standard manipulation are briefly commented on. We present a critical assessment of chromatographic methods developed for the determination of carotenoids in foods. Finally, some methods for carotenoid ester separation are reviewed.",p
"Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy.","Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for >1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged <5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.",p
Food intake regulation in children. Fat and sugar substitutes and intake.,"A series of experiments exploring children's responsiveness to manipulations of energy density and macronutrient content of foods have been reviewed to assess the nutritional impact of macronutrient substitutes on children's intake. In these experiments, the focus is on the extent to which the energy content of foods was a salient factor influencing children's food intake, and macronutrient substitutes were used as tools to investigate this issue. Therefore, although several different macronutrient substitutes have been used in this research, we do not have a parametric set of experiments systematically assessing the impact of a variety of macronutrient substitutes. Given this, what can we conclude from the existing data? When the energy density and macronutrient content of foods is altered through the use of macronutrient substitutes that reduce the energy content of foods, children tend to adjust for the missing energy, although this adjustment may be partial and incomplete. This suggests the possibility that when macronutrient substitutes are used to reduce the energy content of foods, children's energy intake may be reduced. This adjustment, however, will most likely be less than a ""calorie for calorie"" reduction. In addition, even among young children, there are individual differences in the extent to which children adjust their intake in response to macronutrient and energy manipulations. The data are more extensive and particularly clear for cases in which CHO manipulations are used to alter energy density, but there is evidence for adjustments in energy intake in response to alterations of the fat content of the diet. The compensation for energy is not macronutrient specific; that is, when the fat content of food is reduced to reduce energy density of foods, children do not selectively consume fat in subsequent meals. This means that manipulations of macronutrient content of foods that reduce foods' energy content may not result in alterations of energy intake, but because these adjustments in energy intake are not macronutrient specific, changes in the overall macronutrient composition of children's diets can be obtained. There does not appear to be anything unique or special about the effects of macronutrient substitutes on children's intake; their effects are similar to those produced by other manipulations of macronutrient and energy content accomplished without macronutrient substitutes (e.g., augmenting foods with fat or carbohydrate to produce macronutrient differences). The research also indicates that under conditions that minimize adult attempts to control how much and what children eat, children can adjust their food and energy intake in response to the alterations of macronutrient and energy content of foods. Whether or not young children adjust food intake to compensate for energy-density changes depends upon their opportunity to control their own food intake as opposed to having their intake controlled by others. Young children's ability to adjust intake in response to alterations in the energy density of foods can be readily disrupted by the imposition of controlling child-feeding practices that attempt to regulate what and how much children eat. We believe that early experiences, including child-feeding practices imposed by parents, are major factors contributing to the etiology of individual differences and gender differences in the behavioral controls of food intake that can occur in response to the energy content of foods. The extent to which children respond to energy density of the diet has major implications for the effects of fat and sugar substitutes on children's intake. If children who are responsive to energy density consume substantial amounts of foods containing macronutrient substitutes, they should show some adjustments in intake to compensate for reduced energy, so that the impact of macronutrient substitutes on energy intake may be relatively small. However, changes in macronutrient com",p
Occurrence and content of hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid compounds in foods.,"Phenolic acid compounds seem to be universally distributed in plants. They have been the subject of a great number of chemical, biological, agricultural, and medical studies. Hydroxycinnamic acid compounds occur most frequently as simple esters with hydroxy carboxylic acids or glucose, while the hydroxybenzoic acid compounds are present mainly in the form of glucosides. Furthermore, phenolic acids may occur in food plants as esters or glycosides conjugated with other natural compounds such as flavonoids, alcohols, hydroxyfatty acids, sterols, and glucosides. Also, hydroxycinnamic acid amides appear to be common constituents. The occurrence of the different natural phenolic acid compounds in foods is reviewed, and data of the content in fruit, vegetables, and spices are given. The distribution of the main phenolic acid compounds in food plants as well as their changes during development and maturation of fruits are considered. Furthermore, the hydroxycinnamic acids bound to cell wall polymers, the phenolic acid compounds in coffee, cereals, oil seed, and tree nuts, and the analysis of phenolic acid derivatives are reviewed.",p
Taste-active components in some foods: a review of Japanese research.,"Japanese research of taste-active components in seafoods, meat and tomatoes is reviewed. The omission (or addition) test with synthetic extracts simulating natural extracts was employed in most of that research. In abalone, sea-urchin, snow crab, scallop and short-necked clam, glutamic acid (Glu) and glycine were recognized commonly to be taste-active. It was also reported that the synergism between Glu and 5'-ribonucleotides and the presence of sodium and chloride ions were required to produce the characteristic taste of each food. In dried skipjack meat and salted salmon eggs, umami substances such as Glu and inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) were found to be important contributors to their tastes as well. The brothy taste of beef, pork and chicken soups could be reproduced by free amino acids, IMP and sodium chloride, indicating their important roles in producing the taste. A potential effect of Glu and aspartic acid on the taste of tomatoes was observed. Studies of the flavor-enhancing effects on soups and umami solutions of sulfur-containing compounds in garlic are also described.",p
Analytical methods used to measure acrylamide concentrations in foods.,"The state-of-the-art of analysis for acrylamide in food is reviewed. The majority of analytical methods adopts a similar approach: addition of internal standard to the specimen, extraction with water, purification of extract using a solid-phase extraction cartridge, and then determination using either gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) after bromination, or direct measurement with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (LC/MS). The available methods generally show good agreement and are likely to be accurate. However, improvements in precision (within-laboratory) and repeatability (between-laboratory) are needed by particular data users.",p
Gastrointestinal allergy to food: a review.,"Gastrointestinal food allergy still poses a challenge to the clinician because of its variable symptomatology and lack of reliable diagnostic tests. Its prevalence is estimated at 2 approximately 5%, higher in children than in older age-groups. Allergy to food usually diminishes with advancing age. Although a wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions, cow's milk is the most common cause of food allergy in infants and young children. Depending upon the speed of onset of symptoms, immediate and delayed types of food allergy have been described. Gastrointestinal symptoms in food allergy have been explained by alterations in transport across the intestinal wall (increased secretory and/or decreased absorptive functions), increased permeability, and motility of the intestine. The exact pathogenesis of food allergy is still not clear. However, immediate type of food allergy is believed to be mediated by type I hypersensitivity reaction, involving mast cells and food-specific IgE antibodies. The diagnosis of food allergy is based upon a favorable response to an elimination diet and a response to a challenge with the suspected food. The condition is treated by eliminating the allergenic food from diet for as long as 9-12 months in case of cow's milk allergy. While exclusive breast-feeding for the initial four months or more reduces the chances of development of food allergy, the role of diet restrictions in the mother in reducing the incidence of food allergy in the infant is controversial. Data on food allergy from developing countries are limited. This may be due to lack of diagnosis or less attention given to the condition relative to other diseases including infectious diarrheas and acute respiratory infections. The role of cow's milk allergy in the pathogenesis of persistent diarrhoea, a major problem in the developing world, remains speculative. Frequent intestinal infections and reduced secretory IgA, which are associated with malnutrition, alter intestinal permeability and result in an increased uptake of food antigens. The increased antigenic load combined with factors such as an atopic predisposition may initiate an abnormal mucosal immune response resulting in chronic enteropathy.",p
Drug interactions in psychiatric practice.,"The interaction of neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium and anxiolytic sedatives with other drugs and food is reviewed with special emphasis on drug interactions commonly encountered in psychiatric practice. Clinical relevance and mechanism of action of such interactions are discussed. An update of the interaction of lithium with prostaglandin inhibitors is presented.",p
Determination of vitamin D in foods: a review.,"Determining vitamin D content in foods is difficult because in natural foods of highest vitamin D activity, and even in vitamin D-fortified foods, only small quantities are present, and many other compounds are extracted along with vitamin D that cause difficulties in purifying the extract or in the spectrophotometry or colorimetry that follows. Several physicochemical methods--such as spectrophotometric, colorimetric, thin-layer chromatographic, adsorption, partition, gas-liquid, and high-performance column chromatographic--have been tried for assay foods for vitamin D, but none of them have been accepted for official or routine use; they are time consuming and expensive, or lack the required sensitivity, precision, or accuracy. Curative biological assays, based on degree of healing of a leg bone of rats previously made rachitic, is the generally accepted method to determine vitamin D content of foods. However, that method also requires too much time and is expensive. The recently developed high-performance liquid chromatographic method may offer the most for establishing a satisfactory physicochemical method for determining vitamin D in foods. Many of the difficulties and problems in assaying foods for vitamin D are discussed.",p
"Strategies for the determination of bioactive phenols in plants, fruit and vegetables.","Analytical strategies dealing with bioactive phenols in plants and foods are reviewed. These depend on the purpose of the analysis which may be classified as studies where the principal purpose is biological screening, phytochemical and/or chemical screening. Nevertheless, extraction of the phenol from the sample matrix is common and methods of achieving a suitable extract are assessed. Advances in the separation sciences and spectrometry are exploited for identification and quantification of isolated phenols. The various procedures are summarized and some typical ""case studies"" are presented. Two important areas are introduced briefly. Thus, plant phenols are reactive species and their ultimate fate has been relatively neglected. Studies of bioactive compounds generate a considerable volume of data making data handling and informatics important topics that warrant a separate review.",p
Nickel content of food and estimation of dietary intake.,"Nickel contents of foods are reviewed. A thorough knowledge of nickel in food is of new relevance. Among dermatologists it is a general opinion that flare of hand eczema can occur after per oral nickel exposure. The prevalence of nickel allergy in the Danish population is 10% for women and 2% for men. Nickel intake from the Danish diet is estimated as 150 microgram/person/day on average. Roots and vegetables, meal, grain and bread relatively supply the average diet with much nickel. Certain food items, e.g. cocoa and chocolate, soya beans, oatmeal, nuts and almonds, fresh and dried legumes, have very high nickel contents. Consumption of these items in larger amounts may increase the nickel intake to 900 micrograms/person/day or more. Within the range of 600-5,600 micrograms of nickel may provoke hand eczema, when given in single doses as nickel sulphate. An obvious question is thus whether nickel in the diet can cause flare of hand eczema. This should and can only be established by provocation studies with low-level nickel diets combined with a single food having a high nickel content.",p
Inhibition of browning by sulfites.,"The present state of understanding of the mechanisms by which sulfites inhibit browning reactions in food is reviewed. The difficulties of specifying the composition of sulfur(IV) oxospecies in sulfited foods arise from the existence of labile equilibria between SO2, HSO3-, SO3(2-) and S2O5(2-), whose position depends on concentration, ionic strength and the presence of non-electrolytes. A proportion of the additive is also found in a reversibly bound form. The main reason why sulfites are able to inhibit a wide range of browning reactions is the nucleophilic reactivity of sulfite ion. The mechanism of reactions between sulfite species and intermediates in the model Maillard browning reaction, glucose + glycine, are considered in depth and are supported by kinetic data. A most interesting feature is the fact that sulfites seem to catalyse the reactions they are added to control. Reaction products include 3,4-dideoxy-4-sulfohexosulose which is formed initially and polymeric substances arise from the reaction of sulfite species with melanoidins. It is found that melanoidins from glucose + glycine react with sulfite to such an extent that one sulfur atom is incorporated for every two glucose molecules used to make up the polymer. The mechanisms of inhibition of ascorbic acid browning, enzymic browning and lipid browning are reviewed briefly. The known toxicological consequences of the formation of reaction products when sulfites are used for the control of Maillard browning give little cause for concern. Little is known of the implications of the formation of reaction products during the inhibition of other forms of browning. Consideration of the requirements for alternatives to sulfites is given.",p
"Salmonellae, salmonellosis, and dairy foods: a review.","Salmonellae continue to be a major concern for the dairy industry because these bacteria have caused recent outbreaks of illness and have been isolated from various dairy products in the market place. Salmonellae are generally not heat resistant and normally grow at 35 to 37 degrees C, but they can grow at much lower temperatures, provided that the incubation time is suitably extended. To minimize problems, foods should be held at or below 2 to 5 degrees C at all times. Both conventional and rapid methods are available to isolate salmonellae from dairy foods and to identify the bacteria. Salmonellae behave differently in different kinds of cheese: they survived in ripening Cheddar cheese for up to 7 mo at 13 degrees C and for 10 mo at 7 degrees C; in coldpack cheese food for several weeks, depending on the pH and preservative used; and in Domiati cheese 13 to 36 d, depending on the manufacturing process used. When Mozzarella cheese was made, temperatures of stretching and molding (60 degrees C) killed all salmonellae present, but, in cottage cheese, survival of the pathogen depended on the cooking temperature of curd. Spray drying of skim milk killed substantial numbers of salmonellae, but some survivors remained. Butter readily supported growth of salmonellae at room temperature, and neither freezing nor refrigeration for brief periods eliminated salmonellae from butter. Use of appropriate hygienic procedures, e.g., Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system, during processing should reduce the likelihood of salmonellosis outbreaks associated with dairy foods.",p

840 adults with renal insufficiency.


INTERVENTION
Participants were assigned randomly to usual-, low-, or very-low-protein diet groups. Each eating pattern also specified a phosphorus intake goal. Each participant met monthly with a dietitian for an average of 26 months.


STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Analyses of variance and chi 2 analyses.


RESULTS
Dietitians used the following intervention strategies most often in all groups: providing feedback based on self-monitoring and/or food records, reviewing adherence or biochemistry data, providing low-protein foods, and reviewing graphs of adherence progress. In general, the dietitians used feedback, modeling, and support strategies more often, and knowledge and skills strategies less often, with participants who had to make the greatest reductions in protein intake and those with more advanced disease. In all groups, the dietitians' use of knowledge and skills, feedback, and modeling strategies decreased over time (P < .001), whereas use of support strategies was maintained. The type and frequency of intervention strategies used by dietitians and the usefulness ratings of participants did not vary by educational level of the participant. Both self-monitoring and dietitian support were rated as ""very useful"" by 88% of the participants.


CONCLUSIONS
Three features were central to the MDRD Study nutrition intervention program: feedback, particularly from self-monitoring and from measures of adherence; modeling, particularly by providing low-protein food products; and dietitian support. We recommend the self-management approach.",p
Lipid oxidation on foods.,"This review discusses the basic chemical reactions that affect food flavor quality. Although there are many reactions that can lead to the deterioration of quality in foods, this review focuses on lipid oxidation and how it adversely affects flavor principals. It also presents technological advances for studying the basic mechanism of lipid oxidation, for measuring its intensity, and for retaining food quality. The food commodities that provide the subject matter for this review include vegetable oils, legumes, cereal grains, eggs, beef, lamb, poultry, seafoods, and catfish. The methodologies for assessing food quality form a multidisciplinary approach that includes primarily instrumental analysis by direct gas chromatography, chemical analysis by the TBA test, and sensory analysis by quantitative descriptive determinations. The author hopes that the information presented in this review is applicable to food commodities not discussed.",p
"Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora and their impact on foods: a review.","While the risk from pathogenic microorganisms in foods has been recognized for hundreds of years, bacterial agents are generally implicated as the contaminants. Although many outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by protozoan pathogens have occurred, it is only in the last 3 years that attention has focused on protozoan association with foodborne transmission. Recognized as waterborne parasites, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora have now been associated with several foodborne outbreaks. The oocysts and cysts of these organisms can persist and survive for long periods of time both in water and on foods. While Cyclospora oocysts require a maturation period, Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts are immediately infectious upon excretion from the previous host. As a result, these parasites have emerged as public health risks and have become a concern to the food industry. More than 200 cases of foodborne giardiasis (seven outbreaks) were reported from 1979 to 1990. Four foodborne Cryptosporidium outbreaks (with a total of 252 cases) have been documented since 1993. Cyclospora caused a series of sporadic outbreaks of cyclosporasis throughout North America that have affected over 3,038 people since 1995. Control and prevention of protozoan foodborne disease depends upon our ability to prevent, remove, or kill protozoan contaminants. This review will address the biology, foodborne and waterborne transmission, survival, and methods for detection and control of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora.",p
"Dietary fats, teas, dairy, and nuts: potential functional foods for weight control?","Functional foods are similar to conventional foods in appearance, but they have benefits that extend beyond their basic nutritional properties. For example, functional foods have been studied for the prevention of osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. They have yet to be related to the prevention of obesity, although obesity is one of the major health problems today. The inclusion of foods or the replacement of habitual foods with others that may enhance energy expenditure (EE) or improve satiety may be a practical way to maintain a stable body weight or assist in achieving weight loss; such foods may act as functional foods in body weight control. Some foods that might be classified as functional foods for weight control because of their effects on EE and appetite-including medium-chain triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, tea, milk, and nuts-are reviewed here. Only human studies reporting EE, appetite, or body weight are discussed. When studies of whole food items are unavailable, studies of nutraceuticals, the capsular equivalents of functional foods, are reviewed. To date, dietary fats seem to be most promising and have been the most extensively studied for their effects on body weight control. However, the weight loss observed is small and should be considered mostly as a measure to prevent weight gain. Carefully conducted clinical studies are needed to firmly ascertain the effect of tea, milk, and nuts on body weight maintenance, to assess their potential to assist in weight-loss efforts, and to ascertain dose-response relations and mechanisms of action for the 4 food types examined.",p
Food contamination by metals and pesticides in the European Union. Should we worry?,"The estimation of the risk associated with dietary intakes of heavy metals and pesticide residues by the consumer is a vital and integral part of regulatory processes. The exposure of the consumer is compared directly to the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for pesticides and to the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for heavy metals. The exposure is obtained using the basic equation: Exposure (mg/kg b.w./day)=Consumption (mg/kg b.w./day) x Residue (mg/kg). The establishment of the ADI and the TDI is based on the results of toxicological studies that involve the determination of the lowest-no-observed-adverse-effect level/10 (SF1) x10 (SF2), where SF corresponds to 'Safety Factor'. SF1 and SF2 account for interspecies and intraspecies variability, respectively. In order to evaluate the risk for the consumer, that is associated to the presence of heavy metals and pesticides in food, a review of the level of contamination in European countries has been made. The exposure of European consumers to lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury is superior to the TDI. For pesticides, the first step is to compare the detected amount of residues of a specific pesticide to the maximum residue level (MRL) authorized in foodstuffs. If the residue level in food exceeds the MRL, the theoretical maximum daily intakes and the ADI have to be taken into account in order to assess the risk for the consumer.",p
Advances in the use of stable isotopes of minerals in human studies.,"In this review, the current state of development of stable isotope methodology is discussed in relation to its application to human mineral nutrition. The minerals considered are magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, selenium, and lead. Such issues as analytical measurement methodology, the required degree of dietary enrichment, mode of isotope administration, and intrinsic labeling of human foods are reviewed and their current status is presented. It is shown that both mass spectrometry and neutron activation analysis have been applied to various aspects of this research, although the latter more widely. Research need, current problems, and the likely future direction of stable isotopes in human mineral research are summarized.",p
Application of cereals and cereal components in functional foods: a review.,"The food industry is directing new product development towards the area of functional foods and functional food ingredients due to consumers' demand for healthier foods. In this respect, probiotic dairy foods containing human-derived Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species and prebiotic food formulations containing ingredients that cannot be digested by the human host in the upper gastrointestinal tract and can selectively stimulate the growth of one or a limited number of colonic bacteria have been recently introduced into the market. The aim of these products is to affect beneficially the gut microbial composition and activities. Cereals offer another alternative for the production of functional foods. The multiple beneficial effects of cereals can be exploited in different ways leading to the design of novel cereal foods or cereal ingredients that can target specific populations. Cereals can be used as fermentable substrates for the growth of probiotic microorganisms. The main parameters that have to be considered are the composition and processing of the cereal grains, the substrate formulation, the growth capability and productivity of the starter culture, the stability of the probiotic strain during storage, the organoleptic properties and the nutritional value of the final product. Additionally, cereals can be used as sources of nondigestible carbohydrates that besides promoting several beneficial physiological effects can also selectively stimulate the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria present in the colon and act as prebiotics. Cereals contain water-soluble fibre, such as beta-glucan and arabinoxylan, oilgosaccharides, such as galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides and resistant starch, which have been suggested to fulfil the prebiotic concept. Separation of specific fractions of fibre from different cereal varieties or cereal by-products, according to the knowledge of fibre distribution in cereal grains, could be achieved through processing technologies, such as milling, sieving, and debranning or pearling. Finally, cereal constituents, such as starch, can be used as encapsulation materials for probiotics in order to improve their stability during storage and enhance their viability during their passage through the adverse conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. It could be concluded that functional foods based on cereals is a challenging perspective, however, the development of new technologies of cereal processing that enhance their health potential and the acceptability of the food product are of primary importance.",p
Application of near infrared spectrophotometry to the nondestructive analysis of foods: a review of experimental results.,"The authors are reviewing here the development and the application of the nondestructive spectrophotometric analytical techniques applied to the agricultural commodities. Following a short description of the theoretical bases of this technique, the most significant applications are reviewed leading to the evolution of the first generation of instruments based on such principles. The applications of the specific instruments developed for on-line measurements are summarized. The Grain Quality Analyzers actually marketed and their use in the determination of a wide range of components in foods are described. The experience gained by the research developed using such instruments has generated a new series of computerized instruments allowing for new methodologies and applications that are discussed and reviewed here. The state of the art and the development trends are briefly discussed, particularly referring to the research aimed to the extension of this technique to evaluate different chemical compounds in foods, to use as quality indices for agronomic, processing, and marketing purposes.",p
International legislation on trace elements as contaminants in food: a review.,"Environmental contaminants such as trace elements may be present in all foods. Foods, raw materials and ingredients for food production are to an increasing extent traded across borders. Hence, there is a need for international legislation on trace elements as contaminants in food. In 1961, the FAO and WHO established the Codex Alimentarius to elaborate international food legislation. Contaminants in food are handled by the Codex Committee for Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC). The Codex Alimentarius system for developing legislation concerning trace elements as contaminants in food is based upon the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food (GSCTF). By October 2001, the principles for setting maximum limits (MLs) for contaminants in food are agreed, and work is in progress on MLs for trace elements such as lead and cadmium in the various food categories. The status for the proposals is presented and discussed. The EU Regulation 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 sets MLs for lead and cadmium in various foods. This regulation will apply from 5 April 2002. The EU regulation is more detailed but similar to the Codex draft standards for lead and cadmium in food. In future, legislators and administrators in the Codex and EU and analytical chemists will discuss how to use more and better analytical data as risk-management tools to protect public health. Trace elements' speciation is an important aspect of this discussion.",p

Media for the detection and enumeration of Bacillus cereus in foods: a review.,"Bacillus cereus is an established cause of food poisoning in addition to being a troublesome and persistent contaminant, responsible for a variety of spoilage defects in processed foods and dairy products. A range of diagnostic and selective media has been developed to facilitate the detection and enumeration of B. cereus in routine surveillance situations and food poisoning investigations. These media are reviewed with respect to the selective and diagnostic systems they employ, their ability to recover and differentiate the target organism, and their advantages and limitations in particular applications.",p
The thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reaction in foods: a review.,"The wide diffusion of 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in the scientific literature is due to the TBA assay, or TBA test, which has been employed in the determination of autoxidative alterations of fats and oils. Two processes occur in autoxidation, generally: the free radical and the photo-oxidation mechanisms. The better studied is the free radical mechanism. The hydroperoxiepidioxides and bicycloendoperoxides are malonaldehyde (MDA) precursors. The absorption spectrum obtained with oxidized fatty foods is like the spectrum obtained when TBA and MDA react. However, during the secondary phase of the autoxidation process other aldehydes (alkanals, 2-alkenals, dienals) are formed which react with TBA, and they are responsible for off-flavors. Three kinds of pigments (yellow, orange, red adducts) are involved. Also, aromatic aldehydes, which constitute the flavor profile of diverse fruits and essential oils, form with TBA the characteristic arylidene-2-TBA acids. Other substances, such as ketones, ketosteroids, acids, esters, sugars, imides and amides, amino acids, oxidized proteins, pyridines, pyrimidines, and vitamins can react with TBA; they are named TBARS (substances that react with TBA), and form principally in meats and meat derivatives. Several organic or bio-organic acids, as shikimic and sorbic acids, react photometrically with TBA if a Malaprade reaction takes place before. A structural study of the red adduct TBA-MDA has been carried out.",p
Mutagenicity of arylmethane dyes in Salmonella.,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities.",p
"Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, and Comutagenic Aromatic Amines in Human Foods.","Three recent topics related to possible exposure of humans to mutagenic and carcinogenic aromatic amines and related compounds in foods are reviewed. A food additive, AF-2,2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide, was first demonstrated to be mutagenic in Escherichia coli WP-2 and then proved to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. This is an example of prediction of the carcinogenicity of a compound from results of short-term microbial tests. Pyrolysates of amino acids, proteins, and foods high in a protein contain many heterocyclic aromatic amine compounds. For example, a tryptophan pyrolysate contains two derivatives ofamino-gamma-carboline(pyridoindole), and a glutamicd acid pyrolysate contains two derivatives of djipyridoimidazole. These compounds are strong frameshift mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium. Some of them were carcinogenic in an in vitro transformation test and were also carcinogenic when injected sc into hamsters and rats and when given orally to mice. Carcinogenic aromatic amines, such as aniline, and o-toluidine and yellow OB were demonstrated to be mutagenic in the presence of the beta-carboline, norharman, with S-9 mix. Diphenylnitrosamine was also mutagenic in the presence of norharman, which is present in tobacco tar and broiled food. These mutagenicities of aniline, o-toluidine, yellow OB, and diphenylnitrosamine are discussed in relation to an evaluation of compounds as environmental carcinogens from the results of short-term microbial tests.",p
Alkaline-fermented foods: a review with emphasis on pidan fermentation.,"Alkaline-fermented foods constitute a group of less-known food products that are widely consumed in Southeast Asia and African countries. They can be made from different raw ingredients. For instance, Japanese natto, Thai thua-nao, and kinema are made from cooked soybeans, dawadawa from African locust beans, ogiri from melon seeds, ugba from African oil beans, kawal from fresh legale leaves, owoh from cotton seeds, and pidan from fresh poultry eggs. In alkaline-fermented foods, the protein of the raw materials is broken down into amino acids and peptides; ammonia is released during the fermentation, raising the pH of the final products and giving the food a strong ammoniacal smell. Most alkaline fermentations are achieved spontaneously by mixed bacteria cultures, principally dominated by Bacillus subtilis. In other cases, pure cultures can be used. For example, Japanese natto is inoculated with a pure culture of B. subtilis var natto. Pidan is a special example of alkaline fermentation. Instead of using microorganisms, pidan is made using an alkali-treated fermentation. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is produced from the reaction of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), water (H2O), and calcium oxide (CaO) of pickle or coating mud. NaOH penetrates into the eggs, causing the physicochemical changes, color changes, and gelation. The appearance of pidan differs from fresh eggs in that the white becomes a semitransparent tea-brown color, and the yolk is solid or semisolid with a dark-green color. The nutritional value of pidan is slightly decreased compared with fresh eggs, but pidan has an extremely long shelf life and a pleasant, fragrant taste that is preferred by most people in Southeast Asian countries. In a small-scale laboratory study conducted by the authors, B. subtilis was not found in pidan. Four Staphylococcus spp. (S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. warneri) and two strains of Bacillus spp. (B. cereus and B. macerans) were isolated from pidan. Staphylococcus spp. did not contribute to the fermentation and were considered contaminants.",p
Determination of vitamin K in foods: a review.,"Vitamin K receives less dietary attention and fewer assays in foods than other fat-soluble vitamins. It is widely distributed in foods, usually at low concentrations. The human requirement is small. Intestinal bacteria synthesize vitamin K, which presumably helps provide the metabolic requirements for vitamin K. An RDA for vitamin K has not been published, but infants fed milk-substitute formulas risk vitamin K deficiency and it is recommended that those formulas contain supplemental vitamin K. Vitamin K in foods includes phylloquinone (K1) found in plants and several menaquinones (K2) found in animals and synthesized by microorganisms. Many vitamin K methods were developed primarily to identify forms present and determine their relative bioactivities. Until recently bioassays with chicks were the only practical methods to determine vitamin K content of foods. Various physicochemical methods have been developed to determine vitamins K in pure solutions, concentrates, and pharmaceuticals. Because of low concentrations of vitamin K in foods and the extensive purifications of extracts required, there has been only limited use of physicochemical methods, such as column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography, with foods; the latter method perhaps offers the greatest possibilities for further development.",p
Application of ozone for enhancing the microbiological safety and quality of foods: a review.,"Ozone (O3) is a strong antimicrobial agent with numerous potential applications in the food industry. High reactivity, penetrability, and spontaneous decomposition to a nontoxic product (i.e., O2) make ozone a viable disinfectant for ensuring the microbiological safety of food products. Ozone has been used for decades in many countries and recently, the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of this gas has been reaffirmed in the United States. Ozone, in the gaseous or aqueous phases, is effective against the majority of microorganisms tested by numerous research groups. Relatively low concentrations of ozone and short contact time are sufficient to inactivate bacteria, molds, yeasts, parasites, and viruses. However, rates of inactivation are greater in ozone demand-free systems than when the medium contains oxidizable organic substances. Susceptibility of microorganisms to ozone also varies with the physiological state of the culture, pH of the medium, temperature, humidity, and presence of additives (e.g., acids, surfactants, and sugars). Ozone applications in the food industry are mostly related to decontamination of product surface and water treatment. Ozone has been used with mixed success to inactivate contaminant microflora on meat, poultry, eggs, fish, fruits, vegetables, and dry foods. The gas also is useful in detoxification and elimination of mycotoxins and pesticide residues from some agricultural products. Excessive use of ozone, however, may cause oxidation of some ingredients on food surface. This usually results in discoloration and deterioration of food flavor. Additional research is needed to elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of microbial inactivation by ozone and to optimize its use in food applications.",p
Detection of Salmonella in dry foods using refrigerated pre-enrichment and enrichment broth cultures: interlaboratory study.,"An interlaboratory study was performed in 11 laboratories to validate the use of pre-enrichment and tetrathionate brilliant green (TBG35) and selenite cystine (SC35) enrichment cultures refrigerated 72 h at 2-5 degrees C for greater analytical flexibility in the detection of Salmonella in dry foods. Productivities of refrigerated pre-enrichment and enrichment cultures were compared with that of the AOAC/Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) procedure using 4 food types: whole egg powder, milk chocolate, animal feed, and instantized skim milk powder. Uninoculated and inoculated samples were included in each food group. There was complete agreement between the results obtained by the standard AOAC/BAM procedure and the 2 refrigeration procedures. Of 660 samples tested, the AOAC/BAM procedure identified 393 contaminated samples that were readily detected from the corresponding refrigerated pre-enrichment cultures and from the combined productivity of homologous refrigerated TBG35 and SC35 cultures. Refrigeration (72 h) of pre-enrichment or enrichment cultures for greater analytical flexibility and laboratory productivity in the examination of dry foods is under review for adoption by AOAC International.",p
"Aflatoxins in food: occurrence, biosynthesis, effects on organisms, detection, and methods of control.","Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by species of Aspergilli, specifically Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. These molds are ubiquitous in nature and grow on a variety of substrates, thereby producing aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are of great concern due to their biochemical and biological effects on living organisms. In this article, the occurrence of aflatoxins, their biosynthesis, factors influencing their production, their effects on living organisms, and methods of detection and control in food are reviewed. Future areas of research involving mathematical modeling of factors influencing aflatoxin production and alternative methods of control, such as modified atmosphere packaging, are also discussed.",p
Machine Learning for Food Review and Recommendation,"  Food reviews and recommendations have always been important for online food
service websites. However, reviewing and recommending food is not simple as it
is likely to be overwhelmed by disparate contexts and meanings. In this paper,
we use different deep learning approaches to address the problems of sentiment
analysis, automatic review tag generation, and retrieval of food reviews. We
propose to develop a web-based food review system at Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) named NTU Food Hunter, which incorporates different deep
learning approaches that help users with food selection. First, we implement
the BERT and LSTM deep learning models into the system for sentiment analysis
of food reviews. Then, we develop a Part-of-Speech (POS) algorithm to
automatically identify and extract adjective-noun pairs from the review content
for review tag generation based on POS tagging and dependency parsing. Finally,
we also train a RankNet model for the re-ranking of the retrieval results to
improve the accuracy in our Solr-based food reviews search system. The
experimental results show that our proposed deep learning approaches are
promising for the applications of real-world problems.

Chromatographic determination of vitamins in foods.,"Chromatographic methods for the determination of water- and fat-soluble vitamins in foods are reviewed. For each vitamin, sample preparation, detection problems and chromatographic conditions are presented and discussed.

HPLC systems can be automated using in-line solid-phase extraction and column switchings, resulting in very sensitive methods, even when simple UV detection is employed.",p
Exopeptidases and their application to reduce bitterness in food: a review.,"When exopeptidases catalyze hydrolysis of peptide bonds, the product(s) may have a less bitter taste, and the free amino acids or small peptides formed may function in food as pleasant-tasting flavor compounds or as flavor precursors. There are several classes of exopeptidase based on specificity for hydrolysis of synthetic substrates. Exopeptidases in food-stuff may be of natural origin or may be extrinsic, that is, produced by microorganisms or parasites. Exopeptidases used to modify foods are also becoming increasingly available in the industrial enzyme market. Exopeptidases contribute to a variety of quality changes in postharvest fruit, meats, and food fermentations. Foodstuff impacted by these enzymes during processing include cocoa, beer, aged and cured meat products, koji, fish sauce, ripened cheeses, and protein hydrolysates. An important role of exopeptidases in food is the hydrolysis of hydrophobic, bitter peptides. The relationship between peptide structure and sensory transduction/receptor models is discussed. Research on the use of exopeptidases to reduce bitterness is reviewed.",p
Fiducia: A Personalized Food Recommender System for Zomato,"  This paper presents Fiducia, a food review system involving a pipeline which
processes restaurant-related reviews obtained from Zomato (India's largest

food items and manages to identify relevant information pertaining to each item
separately in the reviews. It uses a sentiment check on these pieces of text
and accordingly suggests an appropriate restaurant for the particular item
depending on user-item and item-item similarity. Experimental results show that
the sentiment analyzer module of Fiducia achieves an accuracy of over 85% and
our final recommender system achieves an RMSE of about 1.01 beating other

Direct plating technique for enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes in foods.,"The advantages and disadvantages of various techniques for detecting and enumerating Listeria monocytogenes in foods are reviewed, and results from a study designed to compare 14 direct plating media for their suitability to recover uninjured cells of L. monocytogenes from 4 foods are summarized. McBride Listeria agar (MLA), gum base nalidixic acid tryptone soy agar (GBNTSA), modified Despierres agar (MDA), and modified MLA (MMLA) performed best for recovering all inoculum populations from milk and ice cream mix. For Brie cheese, MLA, MDA, MMLA, and Dominguez Rodriguez isolation agar were superior for recovering L. monocytogenes; GBNTSA, MDA, MMLA, and Donnelly's Listeria enrichment agar were best for recovering the organism from cabbage. Direct plating procedures without prior enrichment can be utilized successfully for recovering L. monocytogenes from foods such as pasteurized milk and ice cream mix, which contain low populations of background microflora. However, recovery of L. monocytogenes from foods such as raw cabbage and Brie cheese, which contain high populations of other microorganisms, was not satisfactory using direct plating procedures.",p
"Fumigants and related chemicals in foods: review of residue findings, contamination sources, and analytical methods.","Public concern over chemical residues in foods increased in the United States during the early 1980s. Potentially hazardous levels of ethylene dibromide (EDB), a relatively non-volatile fumigant, were detected in several finished grain-based products by governmental food-monitoring laboratories. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the use of EDB as a fumigant in 1983. Commercial fumigators then began using more of the highly volatile chemicals such as methyl bromide and phosphine. These chemicals are less likely to leave residues on stored crops than the previously used fumigants such as EDB, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. However, trace residues of many pest-control fumigants and related industrial chemicals are currently found in assorted foods. This contamination may come from the original fumigation of stored crops, or from the industrial chemicals occurring in the environment and in food processing chains. No potential health problem is indicated at this time. Yet scientists continue to uncover the sources of this chemical contamination, and to develop better methods to monitor foods for it. They also seek better ways to protect foodstuffs from pests prior to human consumption.",p
Bacillus anthracis: current knowledge in relation to contamination of food.,"In this article, information related to anthrax and its etiologic agent, Bacillus anthracis, in food is reviewed. The major topics discussed include the taxonomic relationship of B. anthracis to other Bacillus species, methods used for the recovery of the organism from surfaces and foods, routes of infection, the pathogenesis of the organism, the microbial ecology of the vegetative cell and spore in foods and the environment, chemical and physical treatments for spore inactivation, and the control of the disease in animals.",p
Breast feeding and the older infant.,"The possible benefits and disadvantages to the older infant of breast-feeding being continued after the introduction of solid foods are reviewed. The limited evidence from industrialised countries suggests that prolonged partial breast-feeding has little influence on child health and growth. In contrast, in poor areas of the developing world, the continuation of breast-feeding for 1-2 years after the introduction of other foods appears to have several major benefits. These include the supply of nutrients, the delivery of protective, digestive and trophic agents, and extending the period of infertility in the mother. Partial breast-feeding after 6 months is associated with reduced severity of infectious diseases particularly in severely malnourished individuals. There is no evidence that partial breast-feeding plays a causal role in poor growth performance. In poor areas of the developing world, breast-feeding, together with the provision of adequate amounts of other foods, should be encouraged for the first two years of life.",p
"Evaluation of e-beam, gamma- and X-ray treatment on the chemistry and safety of polymers used with pre-packaged irradiated foods: a review.","Polymers used to package food intended for irradiation must currently receive separate US FDA approvals for e-beam, gamma and X-radiation. The three forms of irradiation have virtually indistinguishable effects on polymers held in vacuum. However, in air, irradiation damage is favoured by slow dose rates, such as that characteristic of gamma irradiation. Irrespective of irradiation type, theory and existing polymer irradiation literature both suggest that radiolytic products in food contact polymers should not present a health hazard due to migration into the foods they contain. Equations are presented which calculate the FDA allowable content of radiolytic products to achieve 'threshold of regulation' clearance and conversion of radiolytic yield values (G-values) into ppb concentration in the treated polymer in conformance with FDA practice. An approach to quantifying the functional barrier of a polymer is discussed.",p
Dual role of organosulfur compounds in foods: a review.,"Organosulfur compounds present in natural food are generally considered as beneficial for health because of their antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties. This has led to their excessive and long-term consumption. However, there is also evidence that these compounds demonstrate toxicity and adverse health effects suggesting their potential dual biological roles. Thus, they can act as double-edged biological swords.",p
Carcinogens and mutagens that may occur in foods.,"The principal carcinogens and mutagens that have been identified in human foods are reviewed. These agents may occur in foods as naturally occurring components (e.g., metabolites made by plant or fungal cells), components of contaminating plants or microorganisms, food additives (usually unintentional), or products that arise during processing or cooking. In the mixed diets of developed countries the levels of the known carcinogens and mutagens are very low. However, serious contamination of foods by the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 has occurred in some parts of the world; contamination by N-nitroso compounds or their precursors is another important concern. Extrapolation of the data on the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of chemicals that can occur in foods to an accurate estimation of the potential hazard to human populations is not yet possible.",p
"Effect of gamma irradiation on Listeria monocytogenes in frozen, artificially contaminated sandwiches.","Gamma irradiation has been shown to effectively control L monocytogenes in uncooked meats but has not been extensively studied in ready-to-eat foods. The presence of Listeria in ready-to-eat foods is often due to postprocess contamination by organisms in the food-manufacturing environment. Because gamma irradiation is applied after products are packaged, the treated foods are protected from environmental recontamination. Currently, a petition to allow gamma irradiation of ready-to-eat foods is under review by the Food and Drug Administration. This study was conducted to determine if gamma irradiation could be used to control L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat sandwiches. Ham and cheese sandwiches were contaminated with L. monocytogenes, frozen at -40 degrees C, and exposed to gamma irradiation. Following irradiation, sandwiches were assayed for L. monocytogenes. A triangle test was performed to determine if irradiated and nonirradiated sandwiches differed in sensory quality. We found that the D10-values ranged from 0.71 to 0.81 kGy and that a 5-log reduction would require irradiation with 3.5 to 4.0 kGy. The results of a 39-day storage study of sandwiches inoculated with 10(7) CFU of L monocytogenes per g indicated that counts for nonirradiated sandwiches remained fairly constant. Counts for sandwiches treated with 3.9 kGy decreased by 5 log units initially and then decreased further during storage at 4 degrees C. Sensory panelists could distinguish between irradiated and nonirradiated sandwiches but were divided on whether irradiation adversely affected sandwich quality. Our results suggest that manufacturers of ready-to-eat foods could use gamma irradiation to control L. monocytogenes and improve the safety of their products.",p
