0,Encapsulation in the food industry: a review.,"Encapsulation involves the incorporation of food ingredients, enzymes, cells or other materials in small capsules. Applications for this technique have increased in the food industry since the encapsulated materials can be protected from moisture, heat or other extreme conditions, thus enhancing their stability and maintaining viability. Encapsulation in foods is also utilized to mask odours or tastes. Various techniques are employed to form the capsules, including spray drying, spray chilling or spray cooling, extrusion coating, fluidized bed coating, liposome entrapment, coacervation, inclusion complexation, centrifugal extrusion and rotational suspension separation. Each of these techniques is discussed in this review. A wide variety of foods is encapsulated--flavouring agents, acids bases, artificial sweeteners, colourants, preservatives, leavening agents, antioxidants, agents with undesirable flavours, odours and nutrients, among others. The use of encapsulation for sweeteners such as aspartame and flavours in chewing gum is well known. Fats, starches, dextrins, alginates, protein and lipid materials can be employed as encapsulating materials. Various methods exist to release the ingredients from the capsules. Release can be site-specific, stage-specific or signalled by changes in pH, temperature, irradiation or osmotic shock. In the food industry, the most common method is by solvent-activated release. The addition of water to dry beverages or cake mixes is an example. Liposomes have been applied in cheese-making, and its use in the preparation of food emulsions such as spreads, margarine and mayonnaise is a developing area. Most recent developments include the encapsulation of foods in the areas of controlled release, carrier materials, preparation methods and sweetener immobilization. New markets are being developed and current research is underway to reduce the high production costs and lack of food-grade materials.",pubmed-10627837
0,Does nutritionist review of a self-administered food frequency questionnaire improve data quality?,"OBJECTIVE
This study sought to evaluate the benefit of utilizing a nutritionist review of a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), to determine whether accuracy could be improved beyond that produced by the self-administered questionnaire alone.


DESIGN
Participants randomized into a dietary intervention trial completed both a FFQ and a 4-day food record (FR) at baseline before entry into the intervention. The FFQ was self-administered, photocopied and then reviewed by a nutritionist who used additional probes to help complete the questionnaire. Both the versions before nutritionist review and after nutritionist review - were individually compared on specific nutrients to the FR by means, correlations and per cent agreement into quintiles.


SETTINGS AND SUBJECTS
Three hundred and twenty-four people, a subset of participants from the Polyp Prevention Trial - a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of a low-fat, high-fibre, high fruit and vegetable dietary pattern on the recurrence of adenomatous polyps - were recruited from clinical centres at the University of Utah, University of Buffalo, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Kaiser Permanente Medical Program in Oakland.


RESULTS
Reviewing the FFQ increased correlations with the FR for every nutrient, and per cent agreement into quintiles for all nutrients except calcium. Energy was underestimated in both versions of the FFQ but to a lesser degree in the version with review.


CONCLUSIONS
One must further evaluate whether the increases seen with nutritionist review of the FFQ will enhance our ability to predict diet-disease relationships and whether it is cost-effective when participant burden and money spent utilizing trained personnel are considered.",pubmed-10656476
0,"Dose-response in double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenges in children with atopic dermatitis.","BACKGROUND
Double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenges (DBPCFCs) are considered the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing food hypersensitivity, but the dose that elicits positive challenges, or determinants that may predict dose-response relationships, have not been reported.


OBJECTIVE
Our purpose was to determine the quantity of food that elicits reactions during DBPCFCs and to evaluate parameters that may predict the provocative dose and severity of reaction.


METHODS
We reviewed challenge data for all positive challenges to 6 common allergenic foods in children with atopic dermatitis evaluated for food allergy over a 13-year period. Challenge food was generally administered in 6 doses at 10- to 15-minute intervals beginning with 400 to 500 mg and completing with a total of 8 to 10 g of food. An open feeding of a larger portion followed negative challenges. At the physician's discretion, a lower starting dose was occasionally used (100 mg, 250 mg). Food-specific IgE antibody concentrations (radioallergosorbent test [RAST]) were determined on stored sera of 20% of the challenges selected randomly and 99.6% had prick skin tests (PSTs) performed to the challenged food.


RESULTS
A total of 196 children (45% male; median age 5 y 9 mo; atopic dermatitis 98%, asthma 62%) had 513 positive challenges distributed as follows: egg 267, milk 117, soy 53, wheat 40, peanut 24, fish 12. The percentage of children reacting at the first dose (500 mg or less) was as follows: egg 49%, milk 55%, soy 28%, wheat 25%, peanut 26%, and fish 17%. Twenty-six milk challenges and 22 egg challenges were positive at a first dose of 250 mg; 3 milk challenges and 7 egg challenges were positive at a first dose of 100 mg. Eleven percent of the reactions that occurred on the first dose were severe. The percentage reacting after the final dose of the DBPCFC (or during open challenge) were egg 11%, milk 12%, soy 19%, wheat 12.5%, peanut 8.7%, and fish 25%. There was not a strong correlation between PST absolute wheal size or score (adjusted for histamine controls) and dose at reaction or severity of reaction (R(s) range -0.22 to 0.39 for particular foods). Serum concentration of food-specific IgE did not correlate well with the dose causing a reaction or with severity (R(s) range -0.40 to 0.55 for particular foods).


CONCLUSIONS
This food-allergic population may react to as little as 100 mg of food, possibly less, and the dose causing a reaction and the severity of reaction is not predicted by PST or RAST. Lower doses (100 mg or less) should be investigated for their appropriateness in initiating DBPCFCs.",pubmed-10719311
0,The application of in vitro data in the derivation of the acceptable daily intake of food additives.,"The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for food additives is commonly derived from the NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) in long-term animal in vivo studies. To derive an ADI a safety or uncertainty factor (commonly 100) is applied to the NOAEL in the most sensitive test species. The 100-fold safety factor is considered to be the product of both species and inter-individual differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. Although in vitro data have previously been considered during the risk assessment of food additives, they have generally had no direct influence on the calculation of ADI values. In this review 18 food additives are evaluated for the availability of in vitro toxicity data which might be used for the derivation of a specific data-derived uncertainty factor. For the majority of the food additives reviewed, additional in vitro tests have been conducted which supplement and support the short- and long-term in vivo toxicity studies. However, it was recognized that these in vitro studies could not be used in isolation to derive an ADI; only when sufficient in vivo mechanistic data are available can such information be used in a regulatory context. Additional short-term studies are proposed for the food additives which, if conducted, would provide data that could then be used for the calculation of data-derived uncertainty factors.",pubmed-10654594
0,Microbiological safety evaluations and recommendations on sprouted seeds. National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods.,"In 1997, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF/the Committee) was asked to review the current literature on sprout-associated outbreaks: identify the organisms and production practices of greatest public health concern: prioritize research needs: and provide recommendations on intervention and prevention strategies. In response to this charge, the Fresh Produce Work Group (FPWG) documented the relevant epidemiology and microbial ecology of sprout-associated outbreaks and reviewed current industry practices and initiatives related to the growing of seed and the production of sprouts. Sprouts have been identified as a special problem because of the potential for pathogen growth during the sprouting process. If pathogens are present on or in the seed, sprouting conditions may favor their proliferation. There is no inherent step in the production of raw sprouts to reduce or eliminate pathogens. Contaminated seed is the likely source for most reported sprout-associated outbreaks. Research has been initiated on methods to reduce or eliminate pathogenic bacteria on seeds and sprouts and some treatments show promise. However, to date, no single treatment has been shown to completely eliminate pathogens under experimental conditions used. Finally, the Committee found that, at the time of the charge, there was a lack of fundamental food safety knowledge along the continuum from seed production through sprout consumption. More recently, many have become aware of the potential for this food to be a vehicle for foodborne illness and the need for appropriate controls: however, such awareness is not universal. Although seed appears to be the most likely source of contamination in sprout associated outbreaks, practices and conditions at the sprouting facility may also impact on the safety of the finished product. In recent sprout-associated outbreak investigations, facilities associated with outbreaks did not consistently apply seed disinfection treatments prior to sprouting. Conversely, facilities that used seed from the same lot as an implicated facility, but had not been associated with reported illnesses, appear to have been consistently using seed disinfection treatments, such as 20,000 ppm calcium hypochlorite, to disinfect seed prior to sprouting. The Committee has developed a number of specific recommendations, including: 1. The knowledge of all interested parties pertaining to the microbiological safety of sprouted seeds must be enhanced; government and industry should develop education programs for seed and sprout producers on basic principles for microbiological food safety, good agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, and hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) systems. 2. Good agricultural practices should be systematically implemented to reduce the potential for microbial contamination of seeds for sprout production. 3. Seed cleaning, storage, and handling practices that minimize the potential for microbial contamination should be developed and implemented. 4. Seeds should be treated with one or more treatments that have been shown to reduce pathogenic bacteria that may be present. Intervention strategies that deliver less than a given reduction (at this time, 5-log) in levels of Salmonella spp. and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 should be coupled with a microbiological testing program. 5. Establish good manufacturing practices and food safety systems, including regulatory oversight, microbial testing, adoption of HACCP, and improved traceback, that systematically look for means to prevent seeds from serving as the vehicle for foodborne disease, and 6. Conduct research related to the microbiological safety of sprouted seeds, particularly in the areas of pathogen reduction or elimination, sources of contamination and its prevention, and preventing or retarding pathogen growth during sprouting.",pubmed-10733245
0,Introduction to the reviews on peptides and the control of food intake and body weight.,"The progress in the identification of peripheral and brain peptides that affect food intake and body weight is discussed in the accompanying 11 reviews. The reviews, succinct and critical, are useful guides to a dispersed literature that began in 1957. As reflected through the prism of these reviews, the field looks like a few small islands of scientific understanding surrounded by a vast sea of uncertain phenomena. This introduction discusses four themes that pervade the reviews. These are: (1) how to establish that an effect of a peptide is a physiological function of the endogenous peptide; (2) the importance of the interactions among peptides, amines and steroids for the central integration that underlies the control of food intake and body weight; (3) the need for simple and convenient generalizations to organize and interpret the apparently endless empirical reports; and (4) the persistent problems that remain untouched by current information, especially dietary-induced obesity and the role of peptides in the neural networks that control spontaneous eating.",pubmed-10657509
0,"Rate of intake, bites, and chews-the interpretation of lean-obese differences.","The microstructure of eating behavior reflects physical properties of food. Responses of lean and obese subjects to these physical properties are similar. For example, eating smaller bite-sized food units reduces initial ingestion rate and mean and local ingestion rate for the entire meal, but does not affect total intake in either lean or obese women. On the other hand, analysis of the microstructure of eating behavior also suggests that obese subjects are less hungry and are more motivated by food preferences than lean subjects. For example, in meals of bite-sized food units, initial ingestion rate is less affected by deprivation and more affected by food preference in obese than lean women. In buffet meals with a variety of foods, obese men eat dessert earlier in the meal, and eat more dessert and other energy dense foods than lean men. The research reviewed here suggests that treatments for obesity should not focus on modifying bite size and ingestion rate and other microstructural variables, which are largely determined by the physical properties of food. Instead, treatment should focus on food selection and the stimulatory effects of palatability on intake.",pubmed-10714386
0,Dietary determinants of energy intake and weight regulation in healthy adults.,"Until recently, the percentage of energy from dietary fat has been considered a primary determinant of body fatness. This review covers recent studies from our laboratory that challenge this notion. High and low fat diets matched for energy density, palatability and fiber resulted in similar mean voluntary energy intakes over 9 d; analysis of the individual foods in these diets showed that energy density and palatability were significant determinants of energy intake, independent of fat content. Path analysis further revealed that the influence of energy density on energy intake was in part direct, and in part indirect and mediated by palatability. In another study, dietary variety within food groups was shown to be an important predictor of body fatness, and the direction of the association depended on which food groups provided the variety, i.e., the variety of sweets, snacks, condiments, entrees and carbohydrates consumed was positively associated with body fatness, whereas the variety of vegetables was negatively associated. Last, a study of restaurant food and body fatness showed that the frequency of consumption of restaurant food was positively associated with body fatness, independent of education level, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity. Restaurant meals tend to be high in fat and low in fiber, and thus energy dense. Restaurants also typically serve a variety of palatable foods in large portions. The increasing variety of high energy foods available and the increasing proportion of household income spent on foods consumed away from home may help explain the U.S. national rising prevalence of obesity.",pubmed-10721887
0,The role of enterostatin and apolipoprotein AIV on the control of food intake.,"Procolipase is secreted as a protein consisting of 101 amino acids. In the intestinal lumen, procolipase is activated by trypsin and cleaves to form the active colipase and the pentapeptide from the amino terminus. This pentapeptide is called enterostatin. Pancreatic procolipase synthesis is stimulated by a high-fat diet. A large body of evidence has been gathered in the past decade demonstrating the role of enterostatin in the inhibition of food intake; in particular, fat intake. This aspect of enterostatin will be discussed in this review. Other functions of enterostatin such as the inhibition of insulin secretion, will not. Apolipoprotein AIV is a protein synthesized by the human intestine. Similar to procolipase, the synthesis and secretion of apo AIV are also stimulated by fat absorption. In 1992, Fujimoto et al. first demonstrated that apo AIV is a satiety signal secreted by the small intestine following the ingestion of a lipid meal. Subsequently, this initial observation was followed by a number of studies supporting apo AIV's role in the inhibition of food intake. This review will discuss the role of apo AIV in inhibiting food intake.",pubmed-10657520
0,When will the stork arrive? Patterns of birth seasonality in neotropical primates.,"We review and discuss the ultimate and proximate causes of birth seasonality in Neotropical primates and the seasonal patterns shown by each genus within this group. Our review of the literature shows that most New World monkey populations studied so far show some degree of birth seasonality. Photoperiod is the most important proximate cue used by populations living at relatively high latitudes to time their reproductive events, but almost nothing is known about the proximate factors used by those near the equator. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that food availability is the most important ultimate cause of birth seasonality. Predation seems to promote birth synchrony in some species (e.g., squirrel monkeys). Multiple regression ANCOVA was used to estimate how the degree of birth seasonality is affected by ecological and life history variables. The ANCOVA model shows that three factors affect the degree of birth seasonality: diet, latitude, and body size. Folivores (howlers) are less seasonal than frugivores and insectivores. The degree of seasonality increases with latitude and shows a humped relationship with body size, peaking at 1.66 kg body mass. This last relationship was expected since small bodied species have to pay a cost (in terms of time lost) by being seasonal on a yearly basis, and large species are buffered against fluctuations in food availability due to their large body mass. To understand which of three alternative birth strategies is followed by each species (reduce energy stress during peak lactation, wean infants during peak food availability, or store reserves during peak energy availability), we compared the location of the birth peak in relation to the peak in food-availability for those populations from which data were available. Most species conform to the typical pattern of births concentrated before the peak in food availability, allowing peak lactation (small-sized species) or weaning (capuchins) to take place before the start of the lean season. The pattern of births of the atelines is consistent with the weaning hypothesis. However, since they give birth during the lean season, this pattern is also consistent with an alternative strategy.",pubmed-10676708
