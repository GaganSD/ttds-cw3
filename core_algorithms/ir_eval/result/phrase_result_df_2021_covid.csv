"Combat COVID-19 Infodemic Using Explainable Natural Language Processing
  Models","  Misinformation of COVID-19 is prevalent on social media as the pandemic
unfolds, and the associated risks are extremely high. Thus, it is critical to
detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using
natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting
misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language
processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)
to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and
effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with
fact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the
sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good
performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting
misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset
for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good
performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on
both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in
order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve
model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects
experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE),
and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were
significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in
the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition. Our results provided good
implications in detecting misinformation about COVID-19 and improving public
trust.

A tipping point for open citation data,"  Open citation data can improve the transparency and robustness of scientific
portfolio analysis, improve science policy decision-making, stimulate
downstream commercial activity, and increase the discoverability of scientific
articles. Once sparsely populated, public-domain citation databases crossed a
threshold of one billion citations in February 2021, during the COVID-19
pandemic. Shortly thereafter, the threshold of one billion public-domain
citations from the Crossref database alone. Since the relative advantage of
withholding data in closed databases has diminished with the flood of
public-domain data, this likely constitutes an irreversible change in the
citation data ecosystem. The successes of this movement can guide future open
data efforts.

"Nuclear History, Politics, and Futures from (A)toms-to(Z)oom: Design and
  Deployment of a Remote-Learning Special-Topics Course For Nuclear Engineering
  Education","  To address the lack of familiarity with nuclear history common among nuclear
engineers and physicists, we outline the design and deployment of a
special-topics course entitled ""NE290: Nuclear History, Politics, and Futures""
across which we contextualize the importance of the field at its inception, in
current affairs, and in future endeavors. We begin by outlining the gaps in
secondary educational offerings for nuclear history and their importance in
consideration with nontechnical engineering guidelines. We then outline a
number ABET specifications as pedagogical goals for NE290 from which we derive
a list of target student learning objectives. Next, we outline the NE290
syllabus in terms of assignments and an overview of course content in the form
of a class timeline. We provide an extensive description of the materials and
teaching methodologies for the four units of NE290: 20th-Century Physics,
Physics in WWII, the Early Cold War, and the Late Cold War and Modern Era. We
detail the sequence of lectures across the course and historical timelines --
leading up to a showcasing of NE290 final projects which mirror in creativity
the novelty of course offering. Because NE290 was first offered during Spring
2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional measures in the form of new tools
were used to augment the mandate of remote learning such as videoconferencing
technology to recruit geographically diverse guest lecturers, and used the MIRO
tool for virtual whiteboarding. Lastly, we provide an accounting of course
outcomes drawn from student feedback which -- in tandem with the complete
distribution of course material -- facilitates the integration of nuclear
history into the curriculum for the wider nuclear engineering and physics
communities.

Evaluating Deep Learning Approaches for Covid19 Fake News Detection,"  Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have enabled
connection and communication on a large scale. It has revolutionized the rate
at which information is shared and enhanced its reach. However, another side of
the coin dictates an alarming story. These platforms have led to an increase in
the creation and spread of fake news. The fake news has not only influenced
people in the wrong direction but also claimed human lives. During these
critical times of the Covid19 pandemic, it is easy to mislead people and make
them believe in fatal information. Therefore it is important to curb fake news
at source and prevent it from spreading to a larger audience. We look at
automated techniques for fake news detection from a data mining perspective. We
evaluate different supervised text classification algorithms on Contraint@AAAI
2021 Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset. The classification algorithms are
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also
evaluate the importance of unsupervised learning in the form of language model
pre-training and distributed word representations using unlabelled covid tweets
corpus. We report the best accuracy of 98.41\% on the Covid-19 Fake news
detection dataset.

"Using Self-Supervised Feature Extractors with Attention for Automatic
  COVID-19 Detection from Speech","  The ComParE 2021 COVID-19 Speech Sub-challenge provides a test-bed for the
evaluation of automatic detectors of COVID-19 from speech. Such models can be
of value by providing test triaging capabilities to health authorities, working
alongside traditional testing methods. Herein, we leverage the usage of
pre-trained, problem agnostic, speech representations and evaluate their use
for this task. We compare the obtained results against a CNN architecture
trained from scratch and traditional frequency-domain representations. We also
evaluate the usage of Self-Attention Pooling as an utterance-level information
aggregation method. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on
features extracted from self-supervised models perform similarly or outperform
fully-supervised models and models based on handcrafted features. Our best
model improves the Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) from 69.0\% to 72.3\% on a
development set comprised of only full-band examples and achieves 64.4\% on the
test set. Furthermore, we study where the network is attending, attempting to
draw some conclusions regarding its explainability. In this relatively small
dataset, we find the network attends especially to vowels and aspirates.

"Constraint 2021: Machine Learning Models for COVID-19 Fake News
  Detection Shared Task","  In this system paper we present our contribution to the Constraint 2021
COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task, which poses the challenge of
classifying COVID-19 related social media posts as either fake or real. In our
system, we address this challenge by applying classical machine learning
algorithms together with several linguistic features, such as n-grams,
readability, emotional tone and punctuation. In terms of pre-processing, we
experiment with various steps like stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization,
link removal and more. We find our best performing system to be based on a
linear SVM, which obtains a weighted average F1 score of 95.19% on test data,
which lands a place in the middle of the leaderboard (place 80 of 167).

"COVID-19 Digital Contact Tracing Applications and Techniques: A Review
  Post Initial Deployments","  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe global pandemic that has
claimed millions of lives and continues to overwhelm public health systems in
many countries. The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the
human mobility patterns such as daily transportation-related behavior of the
public. There is a requirement to understand the disease spread patterns and
its routes among neighboring individuals for the timely implementation of
corrective measures at the required placement. To increase the effectiveness of
contact tracing, countries across the globe are leveraging advancements in
mobile technology and Internet of Things (IoT) to aid traditional manual
contact tracing to track individuals who have come in close contact with
identified COVID-19 patients. Even as the first administration of vaccines
begins in 2021, the COVID-19 management strategy will continue to be
multi-pronged for the foreseeable future with digital contact tracing being a
vital component of the response along with the use of preventive measures such
as social distancing and the use of face masks. After some months of deployment
of digital contact tracing technology, deeper insights into the merits of
various approaches and the usability, privacy, and ethical trade-offs involved
are emerging. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of digital
contact tracing solutions in terms of their methodologies and technologies in
the light of the new data emerging about international experiences of
deployments of digital contact tracing technology. We also provide a discussion
on open challenges such as scalability, privacy, adaptability and highlight
promising directions for future work.

"Evaluating the COVID-19 Identification ResNet (CIdeR) on the INTERSPEECH
  COVID-19 from Audio Challenges","  We report on cross-running the recent COVID-19 Identification ResNet (CIdeR)
on the two Interspeech 2021 COVID-19 diagnosis from cough and speech audio
challenges: ComParE and DiCOVA. CIdeR is an end-to-end deep learning neural
network originally designed to classify whether an individual is COVID-positive
or COVID-negative based on coughing and breathing audio recordings from a
published crowdsourced dataset. In the current study, we demonstrate the
potential of CIdeR at binary COVID-19 diagnosis from both the COVID-19 Cough
and Speech Sub-Challenges of INTERSPEECH 2021, ComParE and DiCOVA. CIdeR
achieves significant improvements over several baselines.
