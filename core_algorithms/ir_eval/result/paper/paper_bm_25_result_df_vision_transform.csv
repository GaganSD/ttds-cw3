Transformation of Acetobacter xylinum with plasmid DNA by electroporation.,"Genetic analysis of Acetobacter xylinum, a cellulose-synthesizing bacterium, has been limited by lack of a successful transformation method. Transformation of A. xylinum was attempted using two broad-host-range plasmids (pUCD2 and pRK248) and a variety of transformation methods. Methods using CaCl2, freeze/thaw treatments, and polyethylene glycol were unsuccessful. Transformation of a cellulose-negative strain of A. xylinum with plasmid DNA has been achieved with high-voltage electroporation. Electroporation conditions of 25 microF capacitance, 2.5 kV, 400 ohms resistance, and pulse lengths of 6-8 ms were applied to a cell/DNA mixture in a 0.2-cm cuvette. Plasmid pUCD2 transformed at an efficiency of 10(6)-10(7) transformants/micrograms DNA and pRK248 yielded 10(5) transformants/micrograms DNA. The frequency of transformation increased linearly with increasing DNA concentration, while transformation efficiency remained constant. pUCD2 was recovered from transformants following chloramphenicol amplification and observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Both plasmids could be reisolated from Escherichia coli after back-transformation with alkaline lysis DNA preparations from Acetobacter transformants. Electro-transformation of A. xylinum with plasmid DNA suggests its potential use for analysis of the A. xylinum genome.",pubmed-1461938
Identification and quantification of a carcinogen-induced molecular initiation event in cell transformation.,"All transformed foci of Balb/c 3T3 clone A31-1-1 cells induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) (42 out of 42 examined) contained an A to T transversion at codon 61 (A182 to T) of the Ki-ras gene. The transformants induced by other carcinogens tested did not contain such a mutation, except one out of nine 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced transformed foci. Thus, we hypothesized that this mutation is a specific DMBA-induced initiating event in Balb/c 3T3 cell transformation and we have measured its frequency of induction before transformation occurs, employing our recently developed method. Such mutations can be detected in the cell population as early as 3 days after exposure to DMBA. The same mutation was also detected in the Ha-ras gene. No detectable level (< 10(-6) of these mutations was induced by other carcinogens tested. The mutation frequency of the Ha-ras gene reached a plateau after 1 week's exposure, but that of the Ki-ras gene continued to increase. These results suggest that the A182 to T mutation of the Ki-ras gene, but not that of the Ha-ras gene, contributes to morphological transformation of Balb/c 3T3 cells. We have demonstrated that the level of expression of ras genes determines the rate of recruitment of cells into transformation. Quantitative analysis of the frequencies of ras gene mutations (initiation) and of transformation suggests that about 25% of those cells with the Ki-ras mutation were recruited into the full transformation process and that, in the presence of the tumor promoter TPA, about 56% of them completed morphological cell transformation.",pubmed-1437151
Nonmyristoylated Abl proteins transform a factor-dependent hematopoietic cell line.,"N-terminal myristoylation can promote the association of proteins with the plasma membrane, a property that is required for oncogenic variants of Src and Abl to transform fibroblastic cell types. The P210bcr/abl protein of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells is not myristoylated and does not stably transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts; however, it will transform lymphoid and myeloid cell types in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that myristoylation is not required for Abl variants to transform hematopoietic cells. To test this hypothesis, we introduced point mutations that disrupt myristoylation into two activated Abl proteins, v-Abl and a deletion mutant of c-Abl (delta XB), and examined their ability to transform an interleukin-3-dependent lymphoblastoid cell line, Ba/F3. Neither of the nonmyristoylated Abl proteins transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, but like P210bcr/abl, both were capable of transforming the Ba/F3 cells to factor independence and tumorigenicity. Nonmyristoylated Abl variants did not associate with the plasma membrane in the transformed Ba/F3 cells. These results demonstrate that Abl proteins can transform hematopoietic cells in the absence of membrane association and suggest that distinct functions of Abl are required for transformation of fibroblast and hematopoietic cell types.",pubmed-1549131
Rat embryo cells immortalized with transfected oncogenes are transformed by gamma irradiation.,"Cesium-137 gamma rays were used to transform rat embryo cells (REC) which were first transfected with activated c-myc or c-Ha-ras oncogenes to produce immortal cell lines (REC:myc and REC:ras). When exposed to 6 Gy of 137Cs gamma rays, some cells became morphologically transformed with focus formation frequencies of approximately 3 x 10(-4) for REC:myc and approximately 1 x 10(-4) for REC:ras, respectively. Cells isolated from foci of gamma-ray-transformed REC:myc (REC:myc:gamma) formed anchorage-independent colonies and were tumorigenic in nude mice, but foci from gamma-ray-transformed REC:ras (REC:ras:gamma) did not exhibit either of these criteria of transformation. Similar to the results with gamma irradiation, we observed a sequence-dependent phenomenon when myc and ras were transfected into REC, one at a time. REC immortalized by ras transfection were not converted to a tumorigenic phenotype by secondary transfection with myc, but REC transfected with myc were very susceptible to transformation by subsequent ras transfection. This suggests that myc-immortalized cells are more permissive to transformation via secondary treatments. In sequentially transfected REC, myc expression was high whether it was transfected first or second, whereas ras expression was highest when the ras gene was transfected secondarily into myc-containing REC. Molecular analysis of REC:ras:gamma transformants showed no alterations in structure of the transfected ras or of the endogenous ras, myc, p53, or fos genes. The expression of ras and p53 was increased in some isolates of REC:ras:gamma, but myc and fos expression were not affected. Similarly, REC:myc:gamma transformants did not demonstrate rearrangement or amplification of the transfected or the endogenous myc genes, or of the potentially cooperating Ha-, Ki-, or N-ras genes. Northern hybridization analysis revealed increased expression of N-ras in two isolates, REC:myc:gamma 33 and gamma 41, but no alterations in the expression of myc, raf, Ha-ras, or Ki-ras genes in any REC:myc transformant. DNA from several transformed REC:myc:gamma cell lines induced focus formation in recipient C3H 10T1/2 and NIH 3T3 cells. The NIH 3T3 foci tested positive when hybridized to a probe for rat repetitive DNA. A detailed analysis of the NIH 3T3 transformants generated from REC:myc:gamma 33 and gamma 41 DNA failed to detect Ha-ras, Ki-ras, raf, neu, trk, abl, fms, or src oncogenes of rat origin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",pubmed-1475353
Interleukin-1 production by transformed fibroblasts. II. Influence on antigen presentation and T-cell-mediated anti-tumor response.,"Oncogene-transformed fibroblasts which expressed IL-1, spontaneously or after activation with conditioned medium (CM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), regressed in the syngeneic host. Since regression was significantly influenced by the immune competence of the host (see companion report), we speculated that regression was T-cell-mediated. Frequencies of cytotoxic T-cell precursors (CTLp) were in the same range for activated and non-activated, transformed fibroblasts. Furthermore, it was found that lysability of transformed fibroblasts was not influenced by expression of IL-1. These findings exclude the possibility that regression of CM- and LPS-treated transformed fibroblasts may have been due to the appearance of new, strongly immunogenic epitopes. On the other hand, frequencies of CTL were significantly increased after in vivo immunization with IL-1-expressing as compared to IL-1-non-expressing transformed fibroblasts. The in vivo maturation/expansion of CTL could have been the consequence of activation of helper T cells (TH), transformed fibroblast-associated IL-1 delivering the costimulatory signal. Analysis of frequencies and proliferation rates of TH confirmed this assumption. Both parameters were significantly increased after stimulation with transformed fibroblasts expressing IL-1 in comparison to transformed fibroblasts not expressing IL-1. Furthermore, purified T cells apparently depleted of cells expressing MHC class-II antigens, i.e. antigen-presenting cells, proliferated in the presence of transformed fibroblasts expressing IL-1. Since IL-1 rather than MHC class-II antigen expression was the limiting factor, antigen presentation by IL-1-expressing transformed fibroblasts appears unlikely. Instead, maturation of antigen-presenting cells could well have been initiated by tumor-associated IL-1. We conclude that IL-1 expression of transformed fibroblasts plays an important role in the induction of a T-cell-mediated anti-tumor response. The effect is due to increased efficiency in the activation of helper T cells and may be supported by activation of antigen-presenting cells.",pubmed-1531210
Cooperation between the H-ras oncogene and a truncated derivative of the v-myb oncogene in transformation of hamster embryo fibroblasts.,"The ras oncogenes alone fully transform established (immortalized) rodent fibroblasts in a few days, but generally transform early-passage fibroblasts only partially, unless their action is complemented by that of a nuclear, immortalizing, oncogene. Here we show that transfection of second-passage Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts (HEFs) by the EJ-H-ras oncogene coupled to the neo gene, followed by selection with G418, gives rise to apparently normal, or only slightly transformed, clonal colonies, only a few of which become established. The study of two established clonal lines showed that they acquired only after some weeks, and stepwise, the main characteristics of full neoplastic transformation, i.e. anchorage independence, reduced requirement for serum growth factors and tumorigenicity. Later both clonal lines became increasingly tumorigenic and completely independent of exogenous growth and attachment factors, without increase in the expression of the H-ras oncogene. Transfection of one of the clones, early after its isolation, with a truncated derivative of the nuclear v-myb oncogene devoid of its transcriptional negative regulatory domain and able to partially transform chicken embryo fibroblasts [(myb(KXANM)] gave rise to more transformed cells, expressing both EJ-H-ras and myb(KXANM), which became tumorigenic earlier than the controls and remained more tumorigenic later on. With more efficient transfection techniques, numerous foci of fully transformed cells were subsequently obtained, in a few days, in cultures transfected sequentially with EJ-H-ras(neo) and myb(KXANM) and in cultures co-transfected with the two oncogenes. Highly tumorigenic, serum-independent and immortalized clones expressing both oncogenes were obtained from these cultures. Hence, the truncated myb(KXANM) oncogene accelerate the stepwise transformation of unestablished HEFs by the EJ-HH-ras oncogene and, together with this oncogene, fully transforms these same cells in a single step. The two oncogenes acting in cooperation also induce cell immortalization, but myb(KXANM), by itself, is not an immortalizing oncogene. No cooperation was observed between EJ-H-ras(neo) and the unaltered v-myb oncogene.",pubmed-1408144
Cloning and expression of Candida albicans ADE2 and proteinase genes on a replicative plasmid in C. albicans and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"A plasmid vector (denoted pRC2312) was constructed, which replicates autonomously in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. It contains LEU2, URA3 and an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) from C. albicans for selection and replication in yeasts, and bla (ampicillin resistance) and ori for selection and replication in E. coli. S. cerevisiae AH22 (Leu-) was transformed by pRC2312 to Leu+ at a frequency of 1.41 x 10(5) colonies per microgram DNA. Transformation of C. albicans SGY-243 (Ura-) to Ura+ with pRC2312 resulted in smaller transformant colonies at a frequency of 5.42 x 10(3) per microgram DNA where the plasmid replicated autonomously in transformed cells, and larger transformant colonies at a frequency of 32 per microgram DNA, in which plasmid integrated into the genome. Plasmid copy number in yeasts was determined by a DNA hybridization method and was estimated to be 15 +/- 3 per haploid genome in S. cerevisiae and 2-3 per genome in C. albicans replicative transformants. Multiple tandem integration occurred in integrative transformants and copy number of the integrated sequence was estimated to be 7-12 per diploid genome. The C. albicans ADE2 gene was ligated into plasmid pRC2312 and the construct transformed Ade- strains of both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae to Ade+. The vector pRC2312 was also used to clone a fragment of C. albicans genomic DNA containing an aspartic proteinase gene. C. albicans transformants harboring this plasmid showed a two-fold increase in aspartic proteinase activity. However S. cerevisiae transformants showed no such increase in proteinase activity, suggesting the gene was not expressed in S. cerevisiae.",pubmed-1465116
Molecular and genetic analysis of URA5 transformants of Cryptococcus neoformans.,"Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans ura5 mutants were transformed with linearized or circular plasmids containing the C. neoformans orotidine monophosphate pyrophosphorylase gene. Following electroporation, randomly isolated transformants were analyzed for the mitotic and meiotic stability of uracil prototrophy. All stable transformants tested showed nonspecific ectopic integration. Uracil prototrophy in these transformants was stable through meiosis. Some of the stable transformants showed integration of both URA5 and vector sequences, while others lacked any vector sequences. Unstable transformants exhibited the presence of an autonomously replicating plasmid which had undergone significant sequence rearrangement. The autonomously replicating plasmid in the transformants was observed to be the same size or smaller than the transforming plasmid, was maintained in a linear form, and had acquired a genomic sequence(s) with homology to a sequence(s) on all the chromosomes. The conservation of a 300-bp sequence at the 5' end of the URA5 gene was observed in all the rearranged plasmids. These results suggest mechanisms of plasmid maintenance in C. neoformans that are different from those reported for other yeasts. The ura5 mutant was significantly less virulent than the wild type. The transformants did not recover virulence regardless of prototrophic stability.",pubmed-1541525
"Multiple copies of virG enhance the transient transformation of celery, carrot and rice tissues by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.","In an effort to improve the T-DNA-mediated transformation frequency of economically important crops, we investigated the possible enhancement effect of multiple copies of virG genes contained in Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains upon the transient transformation of celery, carrot and rice tissues. Four days after A. tumefaciens infection, we performed histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assays to determine the frequency of transient transformation of calli from celery and carrot, and explants from rice and celery. Additional copies of octopine- and agropine-type virG genes in A. tumefaciens strains containing an agropine-type Ti-plasmid enhanced the frequency of transient transformation of celery and rice. This enhancement ranged from 25% to five-fold, depending upon the source of the virG gene and the plant tissues inoculated. For both rice and celery, we observed a greater enhancement of transformation using A. tumefaciens strains containing additional copies of an octopine-type virG gene than with strains harboring additional copies of an agropine-type virG gene. Multiple copies of virG genes contained in A. tumefaciens strains harboring a nopaline-type Ti-plasmid had a smaller enhancing effect upon the transformation of celery tissues, and no enhancing effect upon the transformation of rice. In contrast, we obtained a three-fold increase in the transient transformation frequency of carrot calli using an A. tumefaciens strain harboring a nopaline-type Ti-plasmid and additional copies of an octopine-type virG gene. Our results show that multiple copies of virG in A. tumefaciens can greatly enhance the transient transformation frequency of celery, carrot and rice tissues, and that this enhancement is influenced by both the type of Ti-plasmid harbored by A. tumefaciens and by the infected plant species.",pubmed-1463842
"Differential expression of hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger RNAs in two experimental models of liver cell proliferation.","Hepatocyte growth factor, a potent hepatocyte mitogen in vitro, appears to trigger hepatocyte regeneration after partial hepatectomy and after acute liver cell necrosis. Transforming growth factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta 1 may also be involved in the control of liver regeneration. In this study we assessed possible roles of hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta 1 on liver cell proliferation in vivo, using a model of choline deficiency that is associated with liver cell necrosis and a model of a hypolipidemic agent (4-chloro-6-(2,3 xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio (N-beta-hydroxyethyl) acetamide) without liver necrosis. Male F344 rats were fed a choline-deficient diet or 0.16% 4-chloro-6-(2,3 xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio (N-beta-hydroxyethyl) acetamide diet for 6 and 4 wk, respectively. Rats were killed periodically, and the expression of hepatocyte growth factor messenger RNA in the liver, lung and kidney was determined by Northern-blot analysis. The levels of transforming growth factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger RNAs in the liver were also determined. Feeding a choline-deficient diet for 1 to 6 wk led to gradual increases in the levels of hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger RNAs in the liver. Feeding a 4-chloro-6-(2,3 xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio (N-beta-hydroxyethyl) acetamide diet for 3 days and 2 wk induced marked enhancement of liver cell proliferation as judged by hepatocyte 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",pubmed-1427663
