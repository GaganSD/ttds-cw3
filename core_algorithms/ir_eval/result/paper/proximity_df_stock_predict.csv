"Does the time horizon of the return predictive effect of investor
  sentiment vary with stock characteristics? A Granger causality analysis in
  the frequency domain","  Behavioral theories posit that investor sentiment exhibits predictive power
for stock returns, whereas there is little study have investigated the
relationship between the time horizon of the predictive effect of investor
sentiment and the firm characteristics. To this end, by using a Granger
causality analysis in the frequency domain proposed by Lemmens et al. (2008),
this paper examine whether the time horizon of the predictive effect of
investor sentiment on the U.S. returns of stocks vary with different firm
characteristics (e.g., firm size (Size), book-to-market equity (B/M) rate,
operating profitability (OP) and investment (Inv)). The empirical results
indicate that investor sentiment has a long-term (more than 12 months) or
short-term (less than 12 months) predictive effect on stock returns with
different firm characteristics. Specifically, the investor sentiment has strong
predictability in the stock returns for smaller Size stocks, lower B/M stocks
and lower OP stocks, both in the short term and long term, but only has a
short-term predictability for higher quantile ones. The investor sentiment
merely has predictability for the returns of smaller Inv stocks in the short
term, but has a strong short-term and long-term predictability for larger Inv
stocks. These results have important implications for the investors for the
planning of the short and the long run stock investment strategy.

"Predicting intraday jumps in stock prices using liquidity measures and
  technical indicators","  Predicting the intraday stock jumps is a significant but challenging problem
in finance. Due to the instantaneity and imperceptibility characteristics of
intraday stock jumps, relevant studies on their predictability remain limited.
This paper proposes a data-driven approach to predict intraday stock jumps
using the information embedded in liquidity measures and technical indicators.
Specifically, a trading day is divided into a series of 5-minute intervals, and
at the end of each interval, the candidate attributes defined by liquidity
measures and technical indicators are input into machine learning algorithms to
predict the arrival of a stock jump as well as its direction in the following
5-minute interval. Empirical study is conducted on the level-2 high-frequency
data of 1271 stocks in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China to validate our
approach. The result provides initial evidence of the predictability of jump
arrivals and jump directions using level-2 stock data as well as the
effectiveness of using a combination of liquidity measures and technical
indicators in this prediction. We also reveal the superiority of using random
forest compared to other machine learning algorithms in building prediction
models. Importantly, our study provides a portable data-driven approach that
exploits liquidity and technical information from level-2 stock data to predict
intraday price jumps of individual stocks.

Stock Price Prediction Using CNN and LSTM-Based Deep Learning Models,"  Designing robust and accurate predictive models for stock price prediction
has been an active area of research for a long time. While on one side, the
supporters of the efficient market hypothesis claim that it is impossible to
forecast stock prices accurately, many researchers believe otherwise. There
exist propositions in the literature that have demonstrated that if properly
designed and optimized, predictive models can very accurately and reliably
predict future values of stock prices. This paper presents a suite of deep
learning based models for stock price prediction. We use the historical records
of the NIFTY 50 index listed in the National Stock Exchange of India, during
the period from December 29, 2008 to July 31, 2020, for training and testing
the models. Our proposition includes two regression models built on
convolutional neural networks and three long and short term memory network
based predictive models. To forecast the open values of the NIFTY 50 index
records, we adopted a multi step prediction technique with walk forward
validation. In this approach, the open values of the NIFTY 50 index are
predicted on a time horizon of one week, and once a week is over, the actual
index values are included in the training set before the model is trained
again, and the forecasts for the next week are made. We present detailed
results on the forecasting accuracies for all our proposed models. The results
show that while all the models are very accurate in forecasting the NIFTY 50
open values, the univariate encoder decoder convolutional LSTM with the
previous two weeks data as the input is the most accurate model. On the other
hand, a univariate CNN model with previous one week data as the input is found
to be the fastest model in terms of its execution speed.

"A Robust Predictive Model for Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

many research work. There is a gamut of literature of technical analysis of
stock prices where the objective is to identify patterns in stock price

over a period of three years (2015 to 2017). Based on the data of 2015 to 2017,
we build various predictive models using machine learning, and then use those
models to predict the closing value of NIFTY 50 for the period January 2018
till June 2019 with a prediction horizon of one week. For predicting the price
movement patterns, we use a number of classification techniques, while for
predicting the actual closing price of the stock, various regression models
have been used. We also build a Long and Short-Term Memory - based deep
learning network for predicting the closing price of the stocks and compare the
prediction accuracies of the machine learning models with the LSTM model. We
further augment the predictive model by integrating a sentiment analysis module
on twitter data to correlate the public sentiment of stock prices with the
market sentiment. This has been done using twitter sentiment and previous week
closing values to predict stock price movement for the next week. We tested our
proposed scheme using a cross validation method based on Self Organizing Fuzzy
