Temporal Relational Ranking for Stock Prediction,"  Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to
help investors to make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for
stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of
deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a
promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning
solutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting
the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically
formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a
regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely
treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich
relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same
sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.
In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational
Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing
solutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock
ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The
key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network
modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal
evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform
back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It
outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average
return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.

"Absolute Value Constraint: The Reason for Invalid Performance Evaluation
  Results of Neural Network Models for Stock Price Prediction","  Neural networks for stock price prediction(NNSPP) have been popular for
decades. However, most of its study results remain in the research paper and
cannot truly play a role in the securities market. One of the main reasons
leading to this situation is that the prediction error(PE) based evaluation
results have statistical flaws. Its prediction results cannot represent the
most critical financial direction attributes. So it cannot provide investors
with convincing, interpretable, and consistent model performance evaluation
results for practical applications in the securities market. To illustrate, we
have used data selected from 20 stock datasets over six years from the Shanghai
and Shenzhen stock market in China, and 20 stock datasets from NASDAQ and NYSE
in the USA. We implement six shallow and deep neural networks to predict stock
prices and use four prediction error measures for evaluation. The results show
that the prediction error value only partially reflects the model accuracy of
the stock price prediction, and cannot reflect the change in the direction of
the model predicted stock price. This characteristic determines that PE is not
suitable as an evaluation indicator of NNSPP. Otherwise, it will bring huge
potential risks to investors. Therefore, this paper establishes an experiment
platform to confirm that the PE method is not suitable for the NNSPP
evaluation, and provides a theoretical basis for the necessity of creating a
new NNSPP evaluation method in the future.
