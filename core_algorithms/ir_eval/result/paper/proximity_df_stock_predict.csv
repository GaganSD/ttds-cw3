"HATS: A Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for Stock Movement
  Prediction","  Many researchers both in academia and industry have long been interested in
the stock market. Numerous approaches were developed to accurately predict
future trends in stock prices. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
utilizing graph-structured data in computer science research communities.
Methods that use relational data for stock market prediction have been recently
proposed, but they are still in their infancy. First, the quality of collected
information from different types of relations can vary considerably. No
existing work has focused on the effect of using different types of relations
on stock market prediction or finding an effective way to selectively aggregate
information on different relation types. Furthermore, existing works have
focused on only individual stock prediction which is similar to the node
classification task. To address this, we propose a hierarchical attention
network for stock prediction (HATS) which uses relational data for stock market
prediction. Our HATS method selectively aggregates information on different
relation types and adds the information to the representations of each company.
Specifically, node representations are initialized with features extracted from
a feature extraction module. HATS is used as a relational modeling module with
initialized node representations. Then, node representations with the added
information are fed into a task-specific layer. Our method is used for
predicting not only individual stock prices but also market index movements,
which is similar to the graph classification task. The experimental results
show that performance can change depending on the relational data used. HATS
which can automatically select information outperformed all the existing
methods.

Temporal Relational Ranking for Stock Prediction,"  Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to
help investors to make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for
stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of
deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a
promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning
solutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting
the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically
formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a
regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely
treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich
relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same
sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.
In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational
Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing
solutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock
ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The
key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network
modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal
evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform
back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It
outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average
return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.
