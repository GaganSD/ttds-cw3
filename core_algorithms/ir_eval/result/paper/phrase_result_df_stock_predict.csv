A Rational Finance Explanation of the Stock Predictability Puzzle,"  In this paper, we address one of the main puzzles in finance observed in the
stock market by proponents of behavioral finance: the stock predictability
puzzle. We offer a statistical model within the context of rational finance
which can be used without relying on behavioral finance assumptions to model
the predictability of stock returns. We incorporate the predictability of stock
returns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,
we analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices
by defining a forward-looking measure which we call ""implied excess
predictability"". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's
predictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing
function of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These
empirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices
by spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price
significantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the
underlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing
formula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return
predictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock
return predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,
spot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of
the stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find
that the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk
premium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.

"Predicting Future Shanghai Stock Market Price using ANN in the Period
  21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016","  Predicting the prices of stocks at any stock market remains a quest for many
investors and researchers. Those who trade at the stock market tend to use
technical, fundamental or time series analysis in their predictions. These
methods usually guide on trends and not the exact likely prices. It is for this
reason that Artificial Intelligence systems, such as Artificial Neural Network,
that is feedforward multi-layer perceptron with error backpropagation, can be
used for such predictions. A difficulty in neural network application is the
determination of suitable network parameters. A previous research by the author
already determined the network parameters as 5:21:21:1 with 80% training data
or 4-year of training data as a good enough model for stock prediction. This
model has been put to the test in predicting selected Shanghai Stock Exchange
stocks in the future period of 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016, about one week after
the publication of these predictions. The research aims at confirming that
simple neural network systems can be quite powerful in typical stock market
predictions.

"HATS: A Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for Stock Movement
  Prediction","  Many researchers both in academia and industry have long been interested in
the stock market. Numerous approaches were developed to accurately predict
future trends in stock prices. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
utilizing graph-structured data in computer science research communities.
Methods that use relational data for stock market prediction have been recently
proposed, but they are still in their infancy. First, the quality of collected
information from different types of relations can vary considerably. No
existing work has focused on the effect of using different types of relations
on stock market prediction or finding an effective way to selectively aggregate
information on different relation types. Furthermore, existing works have
focused on only individual stock prediction which is similar to the node
classification task. To address this, we propose a hierarchical attention
network for stock prediction (HATS) which uses relational data for stock market
prediction. Our HATS method selectively aggregates information on different
relation types and adds the information to the representations of each company.
Specifically, node representations are initialized with features extracted from
a feature extraction module. HATS is used as a relational modeling module with
initialized node representations. Then, node representations with the added
information are fed into a task-specific layer. Our method is used for
predicting not only individual stock prices but also market index movements,
which is similar to the graph classification task. The experimental results
show that performance can change depending on the relational data used. HATS
which can automatically select information outperformed all the existing
methods.

Temporal Relational Ranking for Stock Prediction,"  Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to
help investors to make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for
stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of
deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a
promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning
solutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting
the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically
formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a
regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely
treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich
relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same
sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.
In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational
Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing
solutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock
ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The
key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network
modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal
evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform
back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It
outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average
return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.

"Evaluating the Performance of ANN Prediction System at Shanghai Stock
  Market in the Period 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016","  This research evaluates the performance of an Artificial Neural Network based
prediction system that was employed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the
period 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016. It is a follow-up to a previous paper in
which the prices were predicted and published before September 21. Stock market
price prediction remains an important quest for investors and researchers. This
research used an Artificial Intelligence system, being an Artificial Neural
Network that is feedforward multi-layer perceptron with error backpropagation
for prediction, unlike other methods such as technical, fundamental or time
series analysis. While these alternative methods tend to guide on trends and
not the exact likely prices, neural networks on the other hand have the ability
to predict the real value prices, as was done on this research. Nonetheless,
determination of suitable network parameters remains a challenge in neural
network design, with this research settling on a configuration of 5:21:21:1
with 80% training data or 4-year of training data as a good enough model for
stock prediction, as already determined in a previous research by the author.
The comparative results indicate that neural network can predict typical stock
market prices with mean absolute percentage errors that are as low as 1.95%
over the ten prediction instances that was studied in this research.

"Share Price Prediction of Aerospace Relevant Companies with Recurrent
  Neural Networks based on PCA","  The capital market plays a vital role in marketing operations for aerospace
industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market
and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies
fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable.
To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well
understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a
hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks. We investigated two types of aerospace
industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA
could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could
influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted
features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The
selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical
features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas
fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation.
The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different
types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term
historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical
data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an
intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the
financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies
and business activities in terms of predicted future share price, thus
improving the return on investment. Currently, COVID-19 severely influences
aerospace industries. The developed approach can be used to predict the share
price of aerospace industries at post COVID-19 time.
