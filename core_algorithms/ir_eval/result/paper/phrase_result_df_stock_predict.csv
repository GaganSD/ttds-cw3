"Stock price direction prediction by directly using prices data: an
  empirical study on the KOSPI and HSI","  The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early
recommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial
distress warning system for long-term shareholders. Many stock prediction
studies focus on using macroeconomic indicators, such as CPI and GDP, to train
the prediction model. However, daily data of the macroeconomic indicators are
almost impossible to obtain. Thus, those methods are difficult to be employed
in practice. In this paper, we propose a method that directly uses prices data
to predict market index direction and stock price direction. An extensive
empirical study of the proposed method is presented on the Korean Composite
Stock Price Index (KOSPI) and Hang Seng Index (HSI), as well as the individual
constituents included in the indices. The experimental results show notably
high hit ratios in predicting the movements of the individual constituents in
the KOSPI and HIS.

A Tensor-Based Sub-Mode Coordinate Algorithm for Stock Prediction,"  The investment on the stock market is prone to be affected by the Internet.
For the purpose of improving the prediction accuracy, we propose a multi-task
stock prediction model that not only considers the stock correlations but also
supports multi-source data fusion. Our proposed model first utilizes tensor to
integrate the multi-sourced data, including financial Web news, investors'
sentiments extracted from the social network and some quantitative data on
stocks. In this way, the intrinsic relationships among different information
sources can be captured, and meanwhile, multi-sourced information can be
complemented to solve the data sparsity problem. Secondly, we propose an
improved sub-mode coordinate algorithm (SMC). SMC is based on the stock
similarity, aiming to reduce the variance of their subspace in each dimension
produced by the tensor decomposition. The algorithm is able to improve the
quality of the input features, and thus improves the prediction accuracy. And
the paper utilizes the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to
predict the stock fluctuation trends. Finally, the experiments on 78 A-share
stocks in CSI 100 and thirteen popular HK stocks in the year 2015 and 2016 are
conducted. The results demonstrate the improvement on the prediction accuracy
and the effectiveness of the proposed model.

"Evaluating the Performance of ANN Prediction System at Shanghai Stock
  Market in the Period 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016","  This research evaluates the performance of an Artificial Neural Network based
prediction system that was employed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the
period 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016. It is a follow-up to a previous paper in
which the prices were predicted and published before September 21. Stock market
price prediction remains an important quest for investors and researchers. This
research used an Artificial Intelligence system, being an Artificial Neural
Network that is feedforward multi-layer perceptron with error backpropagation
for prediction, unlike other methods such as technical, fundamental or time
series analysis. While these alternative methods tend to guide on trends and
not the exact likely prices, neural networks on the other hand have the ability
to predict the real value prices, as was done on this research. Nonetheless,
determination of suitable network parameters remains a challenge in neural
network design, with this research settling on a configuration of 5:21:21:1
with 80% training data or 4-year of training data as a good enough model for
stock prediction, as already determined in a previous research by the author.
The comparative results indicate that neural network can predict typical stock
market prices with mean absolute percentage errors that are as low as 1.95%
over the ten prediction instances that was studied in this research.

Machine Learning for Stock Prediction Based on Fundamental Analysis,"  Application of machine learning for stock prediction is attracting a lot of
attention in recent years. A large amount of research has been conducted in
this area and multiple existing results have shown that machine learning
methods could be successfully used toward stock predicting using stocks
historical data. Most of these existing approaches have focused on short term
prediction using stocks historical price and technical indicators. In this
paper, we prepared 22 years worth of stock quarterly financial data and
investigated three machine learning algorithms: Feed-forward Neural Network
(FNN), Random Forest (RF) and Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
for stock prediction based on fundamental analysis. In addition, we applied RF
based feature selection and bootstrap aggregation in order to improve model
performance and aggregate predictions from different models. Our results show
that RF model achieves the best prediction results, and feature selection is
able to improve test performance of FNN and ANFIS. Moreover, the aggregated
model outperforms all baseline models as well as the benchmark DJIA index by an
acceptable margin for the test period. Our findings demonstrate that machine
learning models could be used to aid fundamental analysts with decision-making
regarding stock investment.

Enhancing Stock Movement Prediction with Adversarial Training,"  This paper contributes a new machine learning solution for stock movement
prediction, which aims to predict whether the price of a stock will be up or
down in the near future. The key novelty is that we propose to employ
adversarial training to improve the generalization of a neural network
prediction model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the
input features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is
essentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature.
As such, normal training with static price-based features (e.g. the close
price) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable
models. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate
the stochasticity of price variable, and train the model to work well under
small yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two real-world
stock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solution with
3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, validating the
usefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task.

Stock trend prediction using news sentiment analysis,"  Efficient Market Hypothesis is the popular theory about stock prediction.
With its failure much research has been carried in the area of prediction of
stocks. This project is about taking non quantifiable data such as financial
news articles about a company and predicting its future stock trend with news
sentiment classification. Assuming that news articles have impact on stock
market, this is an attempt to study relationship between news and stock trend.
To show this, we created three different classification models which depict
polarity of news articles being positive or negative. Observations show that RF
and SVM perform well in all types of testing. Na\""ive Bayes gives good result
but not compared to the other two. Experiments are conducted to evaluate
various aspects of the proposed model and encouraging results are obtained in
all of the experiments. The accuracy of the prediction model is more than 80%
and in comparison with news random labeling with 50% of accuracy; the model has
increased the accuracy by 30%.

Temporal Relational Ranking for Stock Prediction,"  Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to
help investors to make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for
stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of
deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a
promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning
solutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting
the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically
formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a
regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely
treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich
relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same
sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.
In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational
Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing
solutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock
ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The
key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network
modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal
evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform
back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It
outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average
return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.

"DP-LSTM: Differential Privacy-inspired LSTM for Stock Prediction Using
  Financial News","  Stock price prediction is important for value investments in the stock
market. In particular, short-term prediction that exploits financial news
articles is promising in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
neural network DP-LSTM for stock price prediction, which incorporates the news
articles as hidden information and integrates difference news sources through
the differential privacy mechanism. First, based on the autoregressive moving
average model (ARMA), a sentiment-ARMA is formulated by taking into
consideration the information of financial news articles in the model. Then, an
LSTM-based deep neural network is designed, which consists of three components:
LSTM, VADER model and differential privacy (DP) mechanism. The proposed DP-LSTM
scheme can reduce prediction errors and increase the robustness. Extensive
experiments on S&P 500 stocks show that (i) the proposed DP-LSTM achieves 0.32%
improvement in mean MPA of prediction result, and (ii) for the prediction of
the market index S&P 500, we achieve up to 65.79% improvement in MSE.

Online Prediction With History-Dependent Experts: The General Case,"  We study the problem of prediction of binary sequences with expert advice in
the online setting, which is a classic example of online machine learning. We
interpret the binary sequence as the price history of a stock, and view the
predictor as an investor, which converts the problem into a stock prediction
problem. In this framework, an investor, who predicts the daily movements of a
stock, and an adversarial market, who controls the stock, play against each
other over $N$ turns. The investor combines the predictions of $n\geq 2$
experts in order to make a decision about how much to invest at each turn, and
aims to minimize their regret with respect to the best-performing expert at the
end of the game. We consider the problem with history-dependent experts, in
which each expert uses the previous $d$ days of history of the market in making
their predictions. We prove that the value function for this game, rescaled
appropriately, converges as $N\to \infty$ at a rate of $O(N^{-1/6})$ to the
viscosity solution of a nonlinear degenerate elliptic PDE, which can be
understood as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Issacs equation for the two-person game. As a
result, we are able to deduce asymptotically optimal strategies for the
investor. Our results extend those established by the first author and R.V.Kohn
[13] for $n=2$ experts and $d\leq 4$ days of history. To appear in
Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics.

"A PDE Approach to the Prediction of a Binary Sequence with Advice from
  Two History-Dependent Experts","  The prediction of a binary sequence is a classic example of online machine
learning. We like to call it the 'stock prediction problem,' viewing the
sequence as the price history of a stock that goes up or down one unit at each
time step. In this problem, an investor has access to the predictions of two or
more 'experts,' and strives to minimize her final-time regret with respect to
the best-performing expert. Probability plays no role; rather, the market is
assumed to be adversarial. We consider the case when there are two
history-dependent experts, whose predictions are determined by the d most
recent stock moves. Focusing on an appropriate continuum limit and using
methods from optimal control, graph theory, and partial differential equations,
we discuss strategies for the investor and the adversarial market, and we
determine associated upper and lower bounds for the investor's final-time
regret. When d is less than 4 our upper and lower bounds coalesce, so the
proposed strategies are asymptotically optimal. Compared to other recent
applications of partial differential equations to prediction, ours has a new
element: there are two timescales, since the recent history changes at every
step whereas regret accumulates more slowly.

"Risk Management via Anomaly Circumvent: Mnemonic Deep Learning for
  Midterm Stock Prediction","  Midterm stock price prediction is crucial for value investments in the stock
market. However, most deep learning models are essentially short-term and
applying them to midterm predictions encounters large cumulative errors because
they cannot avoid anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural
network Mid-LSTM for midterm stock prediction, which incorporates the market
trend as hidden states. First, based on the autoregressive moving average model
(ARMA), a midterm ARMA is formulated by taking into consideration both hidden
states and the capital asset pricing model. Then, a midterm LSTM-based deep
neural network is designed, which consists of three components: LSTM, hidden
Markov model and linear regression networks. The proposed Mid-LSTM can avoid
anomalies to reduce large prediction errors, and has good explanatory effects
on the factors affecting stock prices. Extensive experiments on S&P 500 stocks
show that (i) the proposed Mid-LSTM achieves 2-4% improvement in prediction
accuracy, and (ii) in portfolio allocation investment, we achieve up to 120.16%
annual return and 2.99 average Sharpe ratio.

"Convolutional Feature Extraction and Neural Arithmetic Logic Units for
  Stock Prediction","  Stock prediction is a topic undergoing intense study for many years. Finance
experts and mathematicians have been working on a way to predict the future
stock price so as to decide to buy the stock or sell it to make profit. Stock
experts or economists, usually analyze on the previous stock values using
technical indicators, sentiment analysis etc to predict the future stock price.
In recent years, many researches have extensively used machine learning for
predicting the stock behaviour. In this paper we propose data driven deep
learning approach to predict the future stock value with the previous price
with the feature extraction property of convolutional neural network and to use
Neural Arithmetic Logic Units with it.

Improving Stock Market Prediction via Heterogeneous Information Fusion,"  Traditional stock market prediction approaches commonly utilize the
historical price-related data of the stocks to forecast their future trends. As
the Web information grows, recently some works try to explore financial news to
improve the prediction. Effective indicators, e.g., the events related to the
stocks and the people's sentiments towards the market and stocks, have been
proved to play important roles in the stocks' volatility, and are extracted to
feed into the prediction models for improving the prediction accuracy. However,
a major limitation of previous methods is that the indicators are obtained from
only a single source whose reliability might be low, or from several data
sources but their interactions and correlations among the multi-sourced data
are largely ignored.
  In this work, we extract the events from Web news and the users' sentiments
from social media, and investigate their joint impacts on the stock price
movements via a coupled matrix and tensor factorization framework.
Specifically, a tensor is firstly constructed to fuse heterogeneous data and
capture the intrinsic relations among the events and the investors' sentiments.
Due to the sparsity of the tensor, two auxiliary matrices, the stock
quantitative feature matrix and the stock correlation matrix, are constructed
and incorporated to assist the tensor decomposition. The intuition behind is
that stocks that are highly correlated with each other tend to be affected by
the same event. Thus, instead of conducting each stock prediction task
separately and independently, we predict multiple correlated stocks
simultaneously through their commonalities, which are enabled via sharing the
collaboratively factorized low rank matrices between matrices and the tensor.
Evaluations on the China A-share stock data and the HK stock data in the year
2015 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

"Predicting Future Shanghai Stock Market Price using ANN in the Period
  21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016","  Predicting the prices of stocks at any stock market remains a quest for many
investors and researchers. Those who trade at the stock market tend to use
technical, fundamental or time series analysis in their predictions. These
methods usually guide on trends and not the exact likely prices. It is for this
reason that Artificial Intelligence systems, such as Artificial Neural Network,
that is feedforward multi-layer perceptron with error backpropagation, can be
used for such predictions. A difficulty in neural network application is the
determination of suitable network parameters. A previous research by the author
already determined the network parameters as 5:21:21:1 with 80% training data
or 4-year of training data as a good enough model for stock prediction. This
model has been put to the test in predicting selected Shanghai Stock Exchange
stocks in the future period of 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016, about one week after
the publication of these predictions. The research aims at confirming that
simple neural network systems can be quite powerful in typical stock market
predictions.

A Stock Prediction Model Based on DCNN,"  The prediction of a stock price has always been a challenging issue, as its
volatility can be affected by many factors such as national policies, company
financial reports, industry performance, and investor sentiment etc.. In this
paper, we present a prediction model based on deep CNN and the candle charts,
the continuous time stock information is processed. According to different
information richness, prediction time interval and classification method, the
original data is divided into multiple categories as the training set of CNN.
In addition, the convolutional neural network is used to predict the stock
market and analyze the difference in accuracy under different classification
methods.
  The results show that the method has the best performance when the forecast
time interval is 20 days. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence
and three kinds of moving average are added as input. This method can
accurately predict the stock trend of the US NDAQ exchange for 92.2%.
Meanwhile, this article distinguishes three conventional classification methods
to provide guidance for future research.

Multi-modal Attention Network for Stock Movements Prediction,"  Stock prices move as piece-wise trending fluctuation rather than a purely
random walk. Traditionally, the prediction of future stock movements is based
on the historical trading record. Nowadays, with the development of social
media, many active participants in the market choose to publicize their
strategies, which provides a window to glimpse over the whole market's attitude
towards future movements by extracting the semantics behind social media.
However, social media contains conflicting information and cannot replace
historical records completely. In this work, we propose a multi-modality
attention network to reduce conflicts and integrate semantic and numeric
features to predict future stock movements comprehensively. Specifically, we
first extract semantic information from social media and estimate their
credibility based on posters' identity and public reputation. Then we
incorporate the semantic from online posts and numeric features from historical
records to make the trading strategy. Experimental results show that our
approach outperforms previous methods by a significant margin in both
prediction accuracy (61.20\%) and trading profits (9.13\%). It demonstrates
that our method improves the performance of stock movements prediction and
informs future research on multi-modality fusion towards stock prediction.

"HATS: A Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for Stock Movement
  Prediction","  Many researchers both in academia and industry have long been interested in
the stock market. Numerous approaches were developed to accurately predict
future trends in stock prices. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
utilizing graph-structured data in computer science research communities.
Methods that use relational data for stock market prediction have been recently
proposed, but they are still in their infancy. First, the quality of collected
information from different types of relations can vary considerably. No
existing work has focused on the effect of using different types of relations
on stock market prediction or finding an effective way to selectively aggregate
information on different relation types. Furthermore, existing works have
focused on only individual stock prediction which is similar to the node
classification task. To address this, we propose a hierarchical attention
network for stock prediction (HATS) which uses relational data for stock market
prediction. Our HATS method selectively aggregates information on different
relation types and adds the information to the representations of each company.
Specifically, node representations are initialized with features extracted from
a feature extraction module. HATS is used as a relational modeling module with
initialized node representations. Then, node representations with the added
information are fed into a task-specific layer. Our method is used for
predicting not only individual stock prices but also market index movements,
which is similar to the graph classification task. The experimental results
show that performance can change depending on the relational data used. HATS
which can automatically select information outperformed all the existing
methods.

A Rational Finance Explanation of the Stock Predictability Puzzle,"  In this paper, we address one of the main puzzles in finance observed in the
stock market by proponents of behavioral finance: the stock predictability
puzzle. We offer a statistical model within the context of rational finance
which can be used without relying on behavioral finance assumptions to model
the predictability of stock returns. We incorporate the predictability of stock
returns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,
we analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices
by defining a forward-looking measure which we call ""implied excess
predictability"". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's
predictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing
function of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These
empirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices
by spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price
significantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the
underlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing
formula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return
predictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock
return predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,
spot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of
the stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find
that the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk
premium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.

"Enhancing Stock Market Prediction with Extended Coupled Hidden Markov
  Model over Multi-Sourced Data","  Traditional stock market prediction methods commonly only utilize the
historical trading data, ignoring the fact that stock market fluctuations can
be impacted by various other information sources such as stock related events.
Although some recent works propose event-driven prediction approaches by
considering the event data, how to leverage the joint impacts of multiple data
sources still remains an open research problem. In this work, we study how to
explore multiple data sources to improve the performance of the stock
prediction. We introduce an Extended Coupled Hidden Markov Model incorporating
the news events with the historical trading data. To address the data sparsity
issue of news events for each single stock, we further study the fluctuation
correlations between the stocks and incorporate the correlations into the model
to facilitate the prediction task. Evaluations on China A-share market data in
2016 show the superior performance of our model against previous methods.

"Share Price Prediction of Aerospace Relevant Companies with Recurrent
  Neural Networks based on PCA","  The capital market plays a vital role in marketing operations for aerospace
industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market
and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies
fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable.
To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well
understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a
hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks. We investigated two types of aerospace
industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA
could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could
influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted
features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The
selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical
features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas
fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation.
The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different
types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term
historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical
data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an
intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the
financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies
and business activities in terms of predicted future share price, thus
improving the return on investment. Currently, COVID-19 severely influences
aerospace industries. The developed approach can be used to predict the share
price of aerospace industries at post COVID-19 time.
