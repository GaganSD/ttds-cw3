Vision Transformers with Patch Diversification,"  Vision transformer has demonstrated promising performance on challenging
computer vision tasks. However, directly training the vision transformers may
yield unstable and sub-optimal results. Recent works propose to improve the
performance of the vision transformers by modifying the transformer structures,
e.g., incorporating convolution layers. In contrast, we investigate an
orthogonal approach to stabilize the vision transformer training without
modifying the networks. We observe the instability of the training can be
attributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch
representations. More specifically, for deep vision transformers, the
self-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent
representations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To
alleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in
vision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch
representations for more discriminative feature extraction. We empirically show
that our proposed techniques stabilize the training and allow us to train wider
and deeper vision transformers. We further show the diversified features
significantly benefit the downstream tasks in transfer learning. For semantic
segmentation, we enhance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on Cityscapes and
ADE20k. Our code is available at

Focal Attention for Long-Range Interactions in Vision Transformers,"Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on various computer vision tasks. The ability to capture local and global visual dependencies through self-attention is the key to its success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead, especially for the high-resolution vision tasks(e.g., object detection). Many recent works have attempted to reduce the cost and improve model performance by applying either coarse-grained global attention or fine-grained local attention. However, both approaches cripple the modeling power of the original self-attention mechanism of multi-layer Transformers, leading to sub-optimal solutions.  In this paper, we present focal attention, a new attention mechanism that incorporates both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions.  In this new mechanism, each token attends its closest surrounding tokens at the fine granularity and the tokens far away at a coarse granularity and thus can capture both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively. With focal attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer models, called Focal Transformers, which achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision Transformers on a range of public image classification and object detection benchmarks.  In particular, our Focal Transformer models with a moderate size of 51.1M and a large size of 89.8M achieve 83.6% and 84.0%Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224×224.  When employed as the backbones, Focal Transformers achieve consistent and substantial improvements over the current SoTA Swin Transformers [44] across 6 different object detection methods.  Our largest Focal Transformer yields58.7/59.0boxmAPs and50.9/51.3mask mAPs on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and55.4mIoU onADE20K for semantic segmentation, creating new SoTA on three of the most challenging computer vision tasks.

CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers,"  We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision
Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and
efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both
designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of
Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a
convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These
changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to the ViT architecture (\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while
maintaining the merits of Transformers (\ie dynamic attention, global context,
and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive
experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer
parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when
pretrained on larger datasets (\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream
tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of
87.7\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the
positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can
be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution
vision tasks. Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/leoxiaobin/CvT}.
