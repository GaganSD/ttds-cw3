Accuracy of physical and occupational therapists' early predictions of recovery after severe middle cerebral artery stroke.,"INTRODUCTION
The ability of physical therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs) to predict level of outcome accurately was investigated prospectively in 91 severely disabled stroke patients with a first-ever middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke.


METHODS
Within the second and fifth week after stroke onset, 364 predictions were made by 59 PTs and 47 OTs about walking ability, dexterity, activities of daily living (ADL), need for additional care in ADL, time required to achieve independent walking ability and maximal level of ADL, and destination of discharge at six months after stroke. The functional recovery patterns of stroke patients were assessed by an independent observer. The accuracy of the therapists' predictions was compared with that of derived prediction models. In addition, the influence of characteristics of patients and therapists on the accuracy of the predictions was investigated.


RESULTS
Compared to observed outcomes at six months after stroke, therapists' lowest accuracies of prediction were found for the moment at which maximal ADL score was achieved (rs = 0.07; p = NS), and highest accuracy was for level of dexterity of the hemiplegic arm (rs = 0.78; p <0.01). Therapists' predictions of functional outcome at six months tended to be too pessimistic. No significant differences were observed for dexterity and walking ability when the predictions by PTs and OTs were compared with those of regression models, whereas significant differences were found for the accuracies of OTs' and PTs' first prediction of destination of discharge and second predictions of outcome in ADL and need for additional care in ADL. No significant differences were found between the accuracy of PTs' and OTs' predictions, and their ability to predict functional outcome was not significantly influenced by the characteristics of patient and therapists.


CONCLUSIONS
At two and five weeks after stroke, OTs and PTs can accurately predict level of walking ability and dexterity at six months. The prediction of time required for achieving maximal level of recovery, destination of discharge, outcome of ADL as well as need for additional care in ADL leaves room for improvement.",pubmed-10688342
Temporal Relational Ranking for Stock Prediction,"  Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to
help investors to make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for
stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of
deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a
promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning
solutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting
the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically
formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a
regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely
treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich
relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same
sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.
In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational
Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing
solutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock
ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The
key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network
modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal
evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform
back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It
outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average
return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.

Prediction of peak oxygen uptake in men using pulmonary and hemodynamic variables during exercise.,"PURPOSE
Many attempts have been made to predict peak VO2 from data obtained at rest or submaximal exercise. Predictive submaximal tests using the heart rate (HR) response have limited accuracy. Some tests incorporate submaximal gas exchange data, but a predictive test without gas exchange measurements would be of benefit. Addition of stroke volume and pulmonary function (PF) measurements might increase the predictability of a submaximal exercise test.


METHODS
In this study, an incremental exercise test (10 W x min(-1)) was performed in 30 healthy men of various habitual activity levels. Step-wise multiple regression analysis was used to isolate the most important predictor variables of peak VO2 from a set of measurements of PF: lung volumes, diffusion capacity, airway resistance, and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures; gas exchange; minute ventilation (V(E)), tidal volume (V(T)), respiratory exchange ratio (RER = carbon dioxide output divided by VO2); and hemodynamics (HR, stroke index (SI) = stroke volume/body surface area, and mean arterial pressure). These measurements were made at rest and during submaximal exercise.


RESULTS
Using the set of PF variables (expressed as percentages of predicted), FEV1 explained 30% of the variance of peak VO2. No other PF variables were predictive. After addition of resting hemodynamic data, SI was included in the prediction equation, raising the predictability to 40%. At the 60-W exercise level, 48% of the variance in peak VO2 could be explained by SI and FEV1. At 150 W, the prediction increased to 81%. At this level VCO2/O2 (RER) also entered the prediction equation of peak VO2: 6.44 x FEV1(%) + 13.0 x SI - 1921 x RER + 2380 (SE = 142 mL x min(-1) x m(-2), P < 0.0001). Leaving out the gas exchange variable RER, maximally 64% of the variance in peak VO2 could be explained.


CONCLUSION
In conclusion, inclusion of pulmonary function and hemodynamic measurements could improve the prediction accuracy of a submaximal exercise test. The submaximal exercise test should be performed until a level of 150 W is reached. Noninvasive stroke volume measurements by means of EIC have additional value to measurement of HR alone. Finally, measurement of gas exchange significantly improves the predictability of peak VO2.",pubmed-10731016
A Rational Finance Explanation of the Stock Predictability Puzzle,"  In this paper, we address one of the main puzzles in finance observed in the
stock market by proponents of behavioral finance: the stock predictability
puzzle. We offer a statistical model within the context of rational finance
which can be used without relying on behavioral finance assumptions to model
the predictability of stock returns. We incorporate the predictability of stock
returns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,
we analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices
by defining a forward-looking measure which we call ""implied excess
predictability"". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's
predictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing
function of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These
empirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices
by spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price
significantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the
underlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing
formula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return
predictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock
return predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,
spot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of
the stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find
that the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk
premium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.

Accounting for intubation status in predicting mortality for victims of motor vehicle crashes.,"BACKGROUND
Two of the important predictors of mortality for trauma patients are the Glasgow Coma Scale and the respiratory rate. However, for intubated patients, the verbal response component of the Glasgow Coma Scale and the respiratory rate cannot be accurately obtained. This study extends previous work that attempts to predict mortality accurately for intubated patients without using verbal response and respiratory rate.


METHODS
The New York State Trauma Registry was used to identify 1994 and 1995 victims of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). For the subset of patients who were not intubated, we developed two statistical models to predict mortality: one did not contain verbal response or respiratory rate, and the other contained a predicted verbal response. These were compared with a model that did include verbal response and respiratory rate. We also compared the predictive abilities of the first two models for all MVC patients (intubated and nonintubated) and determined the extent to which intubated patients were at increased risk of dying in the hospital after having adjusted for other predictors of mortality.


RESULTS
For nonintubated patients, the statistical model without verbal response and the model with predicted verbal response had slightly better discrimination and worse calibration than the model that included verbal response and respiratory rate. Predicted verbal response did not improve the strength of the model without verbal response. For all MVC patients (intubated and nonintubated), predicted verbal response was not a significant predictor of mortality when used in combination with the other predictors. Intubation status was a significant predictor, with intubated patients having a higher probability of dying in the hospital than patients with otherwise identical risk factors.


CONCLUSION
Inpatient mortality for intubated MVC patients can be accurately predicted without respiratory rate or verbal response. There appears to be no need for predicted verbal response to be part of the prediction formula, but intubation status is an important independent predictor of mortality and should be used in statistical models that predict mortality for MVC patients.",pubmed-10647569
Topology prediction of Brucella abortus Omp2b and Omp2a porins after critical assessment of transmembrane beta strands prediction by several secondary structure prediction methods.,"In order to propose a reliable model for Brucella porin topology, several structure prediction methods were evaluated in their ability to predict porin topology. Four porins of known structure were selected as test-cases and their secondary structure delineated. The specificity and sensitivity of 11 methods were separately evaluated. Our critical assessment shows that some secondary structure prediction methods (PHD, Dsc, Sopma) originally designed to predict globular protein structure are useful on porin topology prediction. The overall best prediction is obtained by combining these three ""generalist"" methods with a transmembrane beta strand prediction technique. This ""consensus"" method was applied to Brucella porins Omp2b and Omp2a, sharing no sequence homology with any other porin. The predicted topology is a 16-stranded antiparallel beta barrel with Omp2a showing a higher number of negatively charged residue in the exposed loops than Omp2b. Experiments are in progress to validate the proposed topology and the functional hypotheses. The ability of the proposed consensus method to predict topology of complex outer membrane protein is briefly discussed.",pubmed-10698111
Is it better to combine predictions?,"We have compared the accuracy of the individual protein secondary structure prediction methods: PHD, DSC, NNSSP and Predator against the accuracy obtained by combing the predictions of the methods. A range of ways of combing predictions were tested: voting, biased voting, linear discrimination, neural networks and decision trees. The combined methods that involve 'learning' (the non-voting methods) were trained using a set of 496 non-homologous domains; this dataset was biased as some of the secondary structure prediction methods had used them for training. We used two independent test sets to compare predictions: the first consisted of 17 non-homologous domains from CASP3 (Third Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction); the second set consisted of 405 domains that were selected in the same way as the training set, and were non-homologous to each other and the training set. On both test datasets the most accurate individual method was NNSSP, then PHD, DSC and the least accurate was Predator; however, it was not possible to conclusively show a significant difference between the individual methods. Comparing the accuracy of the single methods with that obtained by combing predictions it was found that it was better to use a combination of predictions. On both test datasets it was possible to obtain a approximately 3% improvement in accuracy by combing predictions. In most cases the combined methods were statistically significantly better (at P = 0.05 on the CASP3 test set, and P = 0.01 on the EBI test set). On the CASP3 test dataset there was no significant difference in accuracy between any of the combined method of prediction: on the EBI test dataset, linear discrimination and neural networks significantly outperformed voting techniques. We conclude that it is better to combine predictions.",pubmed-10679525
"A Robust Predictive Model for Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning
  and Natural Language Processing","  Prediction of future movement of stock prices has been a subject matter of
many research work. There is a gamut of literature of technical analysis of
stock prices where the objective is to identify patterns in stock price
movements and derive profit from it. Improving the prediction accuracy remains
the single most challenge in this area of research. We propose a hybrid
approach for stock price movement prediction using machine learning, deep
learning, and natural language processing. We select the NIFTY 50 index values
of the National Stock Exchange of India, and collect its daily price movement
over a period of three years (2015 to 2017). Based on the data of 2015 to 2017,
we build various predictive models using machine learning, and then use those
models to predict the closing value of NIFTY 50 for the period January 2018
till June 2019 with a prediction horizon of one week. For predicting the price
movement patterns, we use a number of classification techniques, while for
predicting the actual closing price of the stock, various regression models
have been used. We also build a Long and Short-Term Memory - based deep
learning network for predicting the closing price of the stocks and compare the
prediction accuracies of the machine learning models with the LSTM model. We
further augment the predictive model by integrating a sentiment analysis module
on twitter data to correlate the public sentiment of stock prices with the
market sentiment. This has been done using twitter sentiment and previous week
closing values to predict stock price movement for the next week. We tested our
proposed scheme using a cross validation method based on Self Organizing Fuzzy
Neural Networks and found extremely interesting results.

Predicting the therapeutic alliance in alcoholism treatment.,"OBJECTIVE
Prediction of the therapeutic alliance in alcoholism treatment (as rated by the client and by the therapist) was examined in light of a range of potentially relevant factors, including client demographics, drinking history, current drinking, current psychosocial functioning and therapist demographics.


METHOD
The data were gathered in Project MATCH. The present analyses were based on data from 707 outpatients and 480 aftercare clients assigned to one of the three Project MATCH treatments. Potential predictor variables were evaluated by first examining bivariate linear relationships between the variables and ratings of the alliance, and then entering blocks of these predictors into multiple linear regression equations with alliance ratings as the dependent variables. All analysis incorporated adjustments for the nonindependence of ratings pertaining to clients seen by the same therapist.


RESULTS
In simple regressions evaluating bivariate relationships, outpatients' ratings of the alliance were positively predicted by client age, motivational readiness to change, socialization, level of perceived social support and therapist age, and were negatively predicted by client educational level, level of depression, and meaning seeking. Therapist ratings in the outpatient sample were positively predicted by the client being female and by level of overall alcohol involvement, severity of alcohol dependence, negative consequences of alcohol use, and readiness to change. Among aftercare clients, ratings of the alliance were positively predicted by readiness to change, socialization and social support, and were negatively predicted by level of depression. Therapist ratings of the alliance in the aftercare sample were positively predicted by the client being female and therapist educational level, and were negatively predicted by pretreatment drinks per drinking day. Of the variables having significant bivariate relationships with alliance scores, only a few were identified as significant predictors in multiple regression equations. Among outpatients, client age and motivational readiness to change remained positive predictors and client education a negative predictor of client ratings of the alliance, while client gender remained a significant predictor of therapist ratings. Among aftercare clients, readiness to change and level of depression remained significant predictors of client ratings, while none of the variables remained a significant predictor of therapist ratings.


CONCLUSIONS
While the data indicate that several client variables predict the nature of both the client's and therapist's perception of the therapeutic alliance, the significant relationships are of modest magnitude, and few variables remain predictive after controlling for causally prior variables. The strongest relationship identified in both the outpatient and aftercare samples is that between clients' motivational readiness to change and their ratings of the alliance.",pubmed-10627108
Value of somatosensory and motor evoked potentials in predicting arm recovery after a stroke.,"OBJECTIVES
Prediction of motor recovery in the arm in patients with stroke is generally based on clinical examination. However, neurophysiological measures may also have a predictive value. The aims of this study were to assess the role of somatosensory (SSEPs) and motor (MEPs) evoked potentials in the prediction of arm motor recovery and to determine whether these measures added further predictive information to that gained from clinical examination.


METHODS
Sixty four patients who had had a stroke and presented with obvious motor deficit of the arm were examined in terms of three clinical variables (motor performance, muscle tone, and overall disability) and for SSEPs and MEPs. Clinical and neurophysiological examinations were done at entry to the study (2 to 5 weeks poststroke), and at about 2 months after stroke. Further clinical follow up was conducted at 6 and 12 months after stroke.


RESULTS
Neurophysiological measures made in the acute phase were of little use alone in predicting motor recovery of the arm at 2, 6, and 12 months after stroke. At 2 months, the absence of SSEPs and MEPs indicated a very poor outcome. Conversely, if the responses were preserved, a great variation in motor outcome was found. Multiple regression analysis showed that the addition of SSEPs and MEPs to the clinical examination increased the possibility of predicting arm recovery in the long term. In the acute phase, the combination of the motor score and SSEPs were best able to predict outcome. The long term outcome based on variables taken at 2 months, was best predicted through incorporating the three clinical measures and MEPs.


CONCLUSIONS
Neurophysiological measures alone are of limited value in predicting long term outcome. However, predictive accuracy is substantially improved through the combined use of both of these measures and clinical variables.",pubmed-10675214
