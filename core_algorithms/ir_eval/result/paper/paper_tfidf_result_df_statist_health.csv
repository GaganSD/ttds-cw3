Ageing in Portugal: regional iniquities in health and health care.,"The health of the Portuguese has improved considerably in the last twenty years. Economic and social transformations that have contributed to the progressive amelioration of problems of feeding, sanitation, hygiene, housing and social conditions in general, as well as health services, have had decisive effect on this phenomenon. The spectacular regression of the indicators related to transmitted diseases, infant, perinatal (more than 50% between 1985 and 1994) and maternal mortality, and the mortality of children 1 to 4 yr old, also reflects this impact. The positive changes that took place in health indicators were reflected in the growth of life expectancy at birth (2.2 yr more for male and 2.3 more for women between 1985 and 1994) in spite of the fact that the difference in life expectancy in relation to EU countries has grown. Improvement in life expectancy, especially in the older age groups, is not normally associated with significant reductions in morbidity. In fact, increased longevity has become more generally associated with chronic illness or other disabilities requiring more medical services and other forms of personal care. This paper reviews some of the evidence for regional differences in the health status of elderly people in Portugal and considers how health services have reacted to these differences. A preliminary study of health status and patterns of utilisation of elderly people was undertaken. After 30 yr of a National Health Service (NHS) in Portugal we may ask why do inequities in health and access to health care of the elderly population persist? Proactive policies to prevent illness and promote health are still relatively underdeveloped in the Portuguese NHS, and the factors that influence health, such as housing, diet and occupational health hazards, remain largely absent from health and welfare policies. Poor accessibility to health services is the most serious barrier consumers have to face in order to get a medical appointment, and this is more relevant to the oldest part of the population. Geographical location of health care facilities unequally affects the ease of access of different groups of consumers and influences utilisation patterns. Examining the distribution of health services resources is an important way to understand the inequities of access to health and to health care.",pubmed-10714924
Access to health care for children with special health care needs.,"OBJECTIVE
To assess the role health insurance plays in influencing access to care and use of services by children with special health care needs.


METHODS
We analyzed data on 57 553 children younger than 18 years old included in the 1994-1995 National Health Interview Survey on Disability. The survey obtained information on special health care needs, insurance status, and access to and use of health services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of insurance with several measures of access and utilization, including usual source of care, site of usual care, missed or delayed care, and use of ambulatory physician services.


RESULTS
Using the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau definition of children with special health care needs, we estimate that 18% of US children under 18 years old had an existing special health care need in 1994-1995. An estimated 89% of these children had some form of health insurance coverage, most often private health insurance. Insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have a usual source of care (96.9% vs 79.2%). Among those with a usual source of care, insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have an identified regular clinician (87. 6% vs 80.7%). Insured children were less likely to report unmet health needs, including medical care (2.2% vs 10.5%), dental care (6. 1% vs 23.9%), prescriptions, and/or eyeglasses (3.1% vs 12.3%), and mental health care (.9% vs 3.4%). Insured children were also more likely to have a physician contact in the past year (89.3% vs 73.6%) and have more physician contacts on an annual basis (8.5 vs 4.1 contacts). Unexpectedly, no differences were found between insured and uninsured children in availability of after hours medical care (evenings and weekends) or satisfaction with care. We also found some modest differences in access between publicly and privately insured children. Privately insured children were more likely to have a usual source of care (97.6% vs 95.3%) and a regular clinician (91.0% vs 81.1%). Privately insured children were also less likely to report dissatisfaction with care at their usual site of care (14. 9% vs 21.0%) and have access to care on evenings and weekends (6.8% vs 13.4%). No substantial differences were found between privately and publicly insured children in prevalence of unmet health needs or delays in obtaining care due to cost.


CONCLUSIONS
This study illustrates the importance of health insurance for children with special health care needs. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that all children with special health care needs have insurance and that remaining access and utilization barriers for currently insured children with special health care needs are also addressed.",pubmed-10742317
Evaluation of children's health insurance: from New York State's CHild Health Plus to SCHIP.,"BACKGROUND
The legislation and funding of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997 resulted in the largest public investment in child health care in 30 years. The program was designed to provide health insurance for the estimated 11 million uninsured children in the United States. In 1991 New York State implemented a state-funded program-Child Health Plus (CHPlus)-intended to provide health insurance for uninsured children who were ineligible for Medicaid. The program became one of the prototypes for SCHIP: This study was designed to measure the association between CHPlus and access to care, utilization of care, quality of care, and health care costs to understand the potential impact of one type of prototype SCHIP program.


METHODS
The study took place in the 6-county region of upstate New York around and including the city of Rochester. A before-and-during design was used to compare children's health care for the year before they enrolled in CHPlus versus the first year during enrollment in CHPlus. The study included 1828 children (ages 0-6.99 years at enrollment) who enrolled between November 1, 1991 and August 1, 1993. A substudy involved 187 children 2 to 12.99 years old who had asthma. Data collection involved: 1) interviews of parents to obtain information about demographics, sources of health care, experience and satisfaction with CHPlus, and perceived impact of CHPlus; 2) medical chart reviews at all primary care offices, emergency departments, and health department clinics in the 6-county region to measure utilization of health services; 3) claims analysis to assess costs of care during CHPlus and to impute costs before CHPlus; and 4) analyses of existing datasets including the Current Population Survey, National Health Interview Survey, and statewide hospitalization datasets to anchor the study in relation to the statewide CHPlus population and to assess secular trends in child health care. Logistic regression and Poisson regression were used to compare the means of dependent measures with and without CHPlus coverage, while controlling for age, prior insurance type, and gap in insurance coverage before CHPlus.


RESULTS



ENROLLMENT
Only one third of CHPlus-eligible children throughout New York State had enrolled in the program by 1993. Lower enrollment rates occurred among Hispanic and black children than among white children, and among children from lowest income levels. PROFILE OF CHPlus ENROLLEES: Most enrollees were either previously uninsured, had Medicaid but were no longer eligible, or had parents who either lost a job and related private insurance coverage or could no longer afford commercial or private insurance. Most families heard about CHPlus from a friend, physician, or insurer. Television, radio, and newspaper advertisements were not major sources of information. Nearly all families had at least 1 employed parent. Two thirds of the children resided in 2-parent households. Parents reported that most children were in excellent or good health and only a few were in poor health. The enrolled population was thus a relatively low-risk, generally healthy group of children in low-income, working families. ACCESS AND UTILIZATION OF HEALTH CARE: Utilization of primary care increased dramatically after enrollment in CHPlus, compared with before CHPlus. Visits to primary care medical homes for preventive, acute, and chronic care increased markedly. Visits to medical homes also increased for children with asthma. There was, however, no significant association between enrollment in CHPlus and changes in utilization of emergency departments, specialty services, or inpatient care. QUALITY OF CARE: CHPlus was associated with improvements in many measures involving quality of primary care, including preventive visits, immunization rates, use of the medical home for health care, compliance with preventive guidelines, and parent-reported health status of the child.

Towards evidence-based health promotion and service provision for new migrants to Australia.,"OBJECTIVES
To examine patterns of health utilization and health information dissemination among immigrants to Australia in the first 6 months of immigration using data from the Longitudinal Study of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA).


METHODS
The population for the LSIA consists of 5178 principal applicants making their first arrival to Australia on a migrant visa between 1 September 1993 and 31 August 1995, inclusive, and who are aged 15 years or over at the time (96% of all principal applicants). The influence of immigration category, country of birth, health status and age on the likelihood of receiving information about health, sources of health information and use of general practitioners were explored using separate logistic regressions for men and women.


RESULTS
Women who received health information were older and less likely to have a chronic illness than women who did not. Men who received health information were older and more likely to be in the Business visa category. Younger women, those in Preferential Family visa categories and bilingual women were more likely than other women to have received health information from an NGO. For men, the only significant predictor of source of health information was being in the Independent visa category. Women who used health services were younger, more likely to have a chronic illness, be proficient in English and less likely to be in the Independent visa category than women who did not. Men who used health services were older, more likely to have a chronic condition and have limited English than men who did not. Men who used health services were more likely to be in the Humanitarian visa class and less likely to be in the Concessional Family or Business visa categories than men who did not use health services. They were also more likely to have been born in Oceania, Middle East and North Africa and Africa.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study indicate that there are important differentials in knowledge of and use of the health system and these differences are unlikely to be captured by using measures based on ethnicity or country of origin alone. Predictors of health service utilization were different for men and women. In particular, age and lack of English proficiency appeared to be barriers to health service use for women. Visa category and country of birth were more important determinants of health service use for men.",pubmed-10705566
Drinking habits and prevalence of heavy drinking among primary health care outpatients and general population.,"AIMS
To identify the target group for brief alcohol intervention in primary health care and to compare the prevalence of heavy drinking in two different primary health care populations and the general population in the same geographical area.


DESIGN
Drinking data were collected from outpatients of primary health care by a questionnaire containing the CAGE test and quantity-frequency alcohol consumption questions and from a sample of the general population by a telephone survey, including the CAGE. The index of heavy drinking was for men three, and for women two, affirmative answers in CAGE which though not specifically a consumption questionnaire is a good marker of heavy drinking.


SETTING
Two different primary health care populations (primary health care clinic and occupational health care clinic) and the general population in a Finnish health care area.


PARTICIPANTS
Consecutive 1861 primary health care clinic and 2942 occupational health care clinic outpatients and 544 randomly selected adults in the general population, contacted by telephone.


FINDINGS
The primary health care clinic patients drank significantly more per occasion than the patients of the occupational health care clinic (75 vs. 66 g. in men; 33 vs. 27 g. in women) and fewer times per week (0.8 vs. 0.9 in men; 0.5 vs. 0.6 in women). The patients in the primary health care clinic also reported drinking more per week (76 vs. 67 g. in men; 23 vs. 19 g. in women); among women the difference was significant. Among men the prevalences of heavy drinking in the primary health care clinic, occupational health care clinic and general population were 20%, 17% and 16%, respectively (p > or = 0.05). Among women the corresponding figures were 9%, 6% and 13% (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The high prevalence of heavy drinking found in the study confirms the importance of brief intervention by general practitioners. The study also indicates that prevalence and drinking habits depend on the type of clinic and heavy drinkers in general may not be over-represented in primary health care. This study raises the question, especially among women, of how to reach and to provide health advice to those heavy drinkers who do not attend primary health care facilities.",pubmed-10615722
Agenda for women's health research. Improving women's musculoskeletal health.,"Increased attention and resources focused on women's health during the past decade have resulted in new offices, policies, and programs of the Federal government. The Office of Research on Women's Health, established by the National Institutes of Health in 1990, is a focal point for all National Institutes of Health-supported efforts to improve women's health through biomedical and behavioral research. The Office of Research on Women's Health ensures women's appropriate inclusion in research studies supported by the National Institutes of Health. Through the development of a comprehensive agenda for research on women's health, the Office of Research on Women's Health encourages the consideration of gender issues and gender differences in health and disease in research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The importance of research to study and improve women's musculoskeletal health has become increasingly recognized. Clinicians, researchers, and representatives of professional and advocacy organizations concerned with women's musculoskeletal health participated in the development of the initial research agenda on women's health in 1991 and participated in the meetings to update and revise the agenda in 1996 and 1997. As a result of meetings convened to review and revise the agenda on women's health for the twenty-first century, many recommendations for additional research on women's musculoskeletal health have been developed and now are being implemented across the National Institutes of Health.",pubmed-10738410
Self-reported health status of low-income mothers.,"PURPOSE
To determine the self-reported health status of low-income mothers before major health and welfare policy reform in the state of Ohio, to compare the health status of this group with the general population age-based norms, and to examine differences in health status among insurance and racial subgroups. Policy makers and others have a need for key health-status information about low-income mothers, a topic for which little empirical data currently exist.


DESIGN
Descriptive using a cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling; 502 women were interviewed at intake sites in four countries in central Ohio, 1995 to 1996.


METHODS
Health status was measured using the general health status index developed by J. E. Ware and colleagues (1995). Two summary measures, one indicating physical health and one indicating mental health, were used and compared with published norms. Multivariate logistic models were examined for depression and physical health status.


FINDINGS
A significant level of depression in the population of low-income mothers was found as were differences in physical health scores by insurance group. People insured privately had the highest physical health scores, while those enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid had scores indicating the poorest health. No significant difference was found between racial groups in self-reported health status.


CONCLUSIONS
Self-reported mental health status is low among some low-income female populations. Physical health is worse for the Medicaid-enrolled group compared to both uninsured and privately insured groups. This poor state of health will likely diminish the success of welfare reform to improve the economic self-sufficiency of these women unless comprehensive health services are available.",pubmed-10628105
Older women and the meaning of health.,"Health promotion has become an essential component of comprehensive health care, especially considering the growing female population. Older women, in particular, have demonstrated an increasing need for preventive services or health care maintenance and promotion. These needs consist of services provided by health care professionals that can help women meet their own self-care demands. However, before the health care needs of women can be met, they first must be identified. Using Orem's Self-Care Theory, a three-part qualitative phenomenological study was conducted in an attempt to understand what health actually means to older women and what types of health behaviors they feel are important to maintain or promote health. Three different groups of women age 55 and older with a variety of education, socioeconomic, and racial backgrounds were interviewed. Their responses were analyzed carefully, and each participant was interviewed a second time to validate recurrent themes regarding their statements about health. Results of the interviews with the three different groups of women were surprisingly similar. Although each participant had a unique application of their definition of health, there were five recurrent themes identified by 75% to 80% of the women. The themes were interactions with a being greater than themselves, acceptance of self, humor, flexibility, and being other-centered. Numerous examples supported the five themes. In addition, several ""healthy behaviors"" also were identified. Based on the findings of this 3-year study, older women seem to have their own perspectives on what health actually means and how they can best monitor or maintain their health. While the list is slightly different than the traditional one prescribed by health care professionals, perhaps it is time to encourage older adults to become more of a partner in their care. These healthy behaviors could be incorporated easily into the treatment and management plans and thereby reflect both parties' definitions of what it means to be healthy. Health care professionals must continue to ask older adults about their view of health and encourage their partnership in health-related issues. All individuals, no matter what age, are being encouraged to assume more responsibility for their own personal health, and by including older adults in the decision-making process, this partnership can be strengthened.",pubmed-10711111
Relationship between modifiable health risks and short-term health care charges.,"CONTEXT
If physical inactivity, obesity, and smoking status prove to contribute significantly to increased health care charges within a short period of time, health plans and payers may wish to invest in strategies to modify these risk factors. However, few data are available to guide such resource allocation decisions.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the relationship of modifiable health risks to subsequent health care charges after controlling for age, race, sex, and chronic conditions.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Cohort study of a stratified random sample of 5689 adults (75.5% of total sample of 7535) aged 40 years or older who were enrolled in a Minnesota health plan and completed a 60-item questionnaire.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Resource use as measured by billed health care charges from July 1, 1995, to December 31, 1996, compared by health risk (physical activity, body mass index [BMI], and smoking status).


RESULTS
The mean annual per patient charge in the total study population was $3570 (median, $600), and 15% of patients had no charges during the study period. After adjustment-for age, race, sex, and chronic disease status, physical activity (4.7% lower health care charges per active day per week), BMI (1.9% higher charges per BMI unit), current smoking status (18% higher charges), and history of tobacco use (25.8% higher charges) were prospectively related to health care charges over 18 months. Never-smokers with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 and who participated in physical activity 3 days per week had mean annual health care charges that were approximately 49% lower than physically inactive smokers with a BMI of 27.5 kg/m2.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest that adverse health risks translate into significantly higher health care charges within 18 months. Health plans or payers seeking to minimize health care charges may wish to consider strategic investments in interventions that effectively modify adverse health risks.",pubmed-10605975
Employment-based health benefits: who is offered coverage vs. who takes it.,"This Issue Brief provides data on employment-based health insurance, with a discussion of recent trends and how sponsorship rates, offer rates, coverage rates, and take-up rates vary for different workers. Other sections examine reasons why workers do not participate in employment-based health plans, alternative sources of health insurance, and uninsured workers. In 1997, 83 percent of the 108.1 million wage and salary workers in the United States were employed by a firm that sponsored a health plan. Of those workers, 75 percent were offered coverage, and 62 percent (or 67.5 million workers) were covered by that plan. Of those workers who worked for an employer that offered them a health plan, 83 percent participated in the plan. Sponsorship rates have barely changed in the last 11 years. In 1988, 83 percent of wage and salary workers reported that their employer sponsored a health plan. This declined slightly to 82 percent in 1993 but had increased to 83 percent by 1997. Offer rates significantly changed between 1988 and 1997. In 1988, 82 percent of workers reported that they were eligible for health insurance through their employer. By 1993, the percentage of eligible workers declined to 74 percent, and it has only slightly increased since then to 75 percent in 1997. In 1997, 40.6 million American workers did not have health insurance through their own job. Forty-five percent of the workers without coverage were employed at a firm where the employer did not provide health insurance to any workers. Thirty-three percent of the workers without coverage were offered coverage but declined it. Twenty-two percent of the workers without coverage were employed in a firm that offered health insurance to some of its workers, but certain workers were not eligible for the health plan. The 13.7 million workers who were offered coverage but declined it gave a number of reasons for doing so. In the majority of cases (61 percent), the worker was covered by another health plan. Of the remainder, 20 percent reported that health insurance was just too costly. Overall, 41 percent of the 40.6 million workers who were not participating in an employment-based health plan through their own employer had coverage through a spouse. However, 42 percent of the 40.6 million workers who declined their employers' health plan or who were not offered health insurance from their employer were uninsured.",pubmed-10620980
