### About this dataset
&gt; <p>Opioid addiction and death rates in the U.S. and abroad have reached ""epidemic"" levels. The CDC's data reflects the incredible spike in overdoses caused by drugs containing opioids.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States is experiencing an epidemic of drug overdose (poisoning) deaths. Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137%, including a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids (opioid pain relievers and heroin). <em>Source: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">CDC</a></em></p>

<p><strong>What are opioids?</strong><br>
Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to produce morphine-like effects. Opioids are most often used medically to relieve pain. Opioids include opiates, an older term that refers to such drugs derived from opium, including morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins.[4] The terms opiate and narcotic are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. <em>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

UNICEF_State_of_World_Children_2021,State of World Children in 2021- Data of UNICEF,"# DESCRIPTION OF EACH TABLE üê± üê≠ üêπ

==============================================
##  TABLE 1. DEMOGRAPHICS ü¶Ä

The demographics table contains selected indicators on some of the most important demographic information of each population, including the total population and broken down by age, as well as annual population growth rates. The annual number of births is a function of both population size and current fertility. The total fertility rate allows for comparison of fertility levels internationally. A total fertility level of 2.1 is called ‚Äòreplacement level‚Äô and represents a level at which, in the long term, the population would remain the same size. Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the health status and the development of a population and continues to increase in almost all countries in the world. The dependency ratio is the ratio of the not-working-age population (i.e., the economically ‚Äòdependent‚Äô population) to the working-age population (15‚Äì64 years). This can be divided into a child dependency ratio (ratio of children under 15 to working age population) and an old-age dependency ratio (ratio of population 65 and older to working-age population). The total dependency ratio is usually U-shaped over time reflecting a changing age structure as a result of the demographic transition. This can be understood as the combination of opposing trends in child and old-age dependency ratios. For example, decreasing fertility leads to a decreasing share of children in the population and therefore to a decrease in the child dependency ratio. Increasing life expectancy (as consequence of decreasing mortality) will lead to a larger share of older people and therefore to an increase in the old-age dependency ratio. The proportion of the urban population and the annual urban population growth rate describe the status and dynamics of the urbanization process. The net migration rate refers to the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants; a country/ area with more immigrants than emigrants shows a positive value, while a country with less immigrants than emigrants shows a negative value. 

================================================
##  TABLE 2. CHILD MORTALITY ü¶é

Each year, in The State of the World‚Äôs Children report, UNICEF presents a series of mortality estimates for children. These figures represent the best estimates available at the time of printing and are based on the work of the United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which includes UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank group and the United Nations Population Division. UN IGME mortality estimates are updated annually through a detailed review of all newly available data, which can result in adjustments to previously reported estimates. As a result, consecutive editions of The State of the World‚Äôs Children should not be used for analysing mortality trends over time. Comparable global and regional under five mortality estimates for the period 1990‚Äì2019 are presented below. 

===============================================
## TABLE 3. MATERNAL AND NEWBORN HEALTH üêØ

The maternal and newborn health table includes a combination of demographic and intervention coverage indicators. The demographic indicators consist of life expectancy for females, adolescent birth rate, and maternal mortality estimates including the number of maternal deaths, maternal mortality ratio, and lifetime risk of maternal death.

=============================================
## TABLE 4. CHILD HEALTH  üê¶

The child health table includes a set of indicators that capture information on the coverage of effective interventions delivered to children under the age of five years and at the household level. These include a range of immunization indicators (described below) and indicators on interventions for the prevention or treatment of pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria (the three leading killers of young children). The main data sources for the indicators on prevention and treatment of childhood illnesses are nationally representative household surveys such as the DHS and MICS. Regional and global estimates are calculated by using a weighted average method. Variables used for weighting are indicator-specific and applied to each country. They accord with the appropriate target population for each indicator (the denominator) and are derived from the latest edition of the World Population Prospects. Only the most recent data points from 2015‚Äì 2020 for each country were used to calculate regional and global estimates. For indicators that capture information about households, total population was used.

===============================================
## TABLE 5. ADOLESCENT HEALTH üêã

This table contains a set of key indicators related to adolescent health, well-being and mortality. Mortality indicators include adolescent mortality rate for ages 10‚Äì19, the number for adolescent deaths as well as the annual rate of reduction in the adolescent mortality rate for the period 2000‚Äì2019. Reproductive health indicators presented in this table include adolescent birth rate, early childbearing (which refers to women aged 20‚Äì24 years who gave birth before age 18) and demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods among adolescents aged 15‚Äì19. The following maternal health indicators are presented for adolescents aged 15‚Äì19: Antenatal care with at least four visits and skilled birth attendant. The following risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are presented: Alcohol use among adolescents ages 15‚Äì19, tobacco use among adolescents ages 13‚Äì15 and insufficient physical activity among school going adolescents ages 11‚Äì17. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is presented for girls who received the last dose of the HPV vaccine per national schedule. WHO/UNICEF produce two main coverage indicators for HPV vaccination. One is the HPV vaccination programme performance coverage that describes vaccination coverage according to a national schedule and the programme‚Äôs eligibility criteria for each calendar year (programme‚Äôs target population up to 14 years of age). The second describes HPV vaccination coverage by age 15, representing the proportion of the population turning 15 in the reporting year who have been vaccinated against HPV at any time between the ages of 9‚Äì14, at any time up to the calendar year in question.

==============================================

## TABLES 6,7: HIV/AIDS ü¶Ç

In 2021, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) released new global, regional and country-level HIV and AIDS estimates for 2020 that reflect the most up-to-date epidemiological estimates. The estimates also reflect coverage data for antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and early infant diagnosis for HIV. The estimates are based on the most current available science and WHO programme guidelines. These guidelines have resulted in improvements in assumptions of the probability of HIV transmission from mother-to-child, fertility among women by age and HIV serostatus, net survival rates for children living with HIV and more. Based on this refined methodology, UNAIDS has retrospectively generated new estimates of HIV prevalence, the number of people living with HIV and those needing treatment, AIDS-related deaths, new HIV infections, and other important trends in the HIV epidemic. Key indicators on the HIV response for children are divided into two tables: Table 6. HIV/AIDS: epidemiology and Table 7. HIV/AIDS: interventions.

================================================
## TABLES 8, 9: NUTRITION üê¥

Table 8 encompasses estimates of malnutrition at birth among pre-school-aged children, school-aged children and women of reproductive age as well as coverage of birth weighing and key micronutrient programmes. Table 9 encompasses feeding practices for infants and young children. Estimates for low birthweight, stunting and overweight among pre-school children, thinness and overweight among school-aged children, and maternal underweight and anaemia are from country models. For this reason, these may be different from survey-reported estimates. For all other indicators, when raw data were available, the country-level estimates were re-analysed to conform to standard analysis methods and may therefore differ from survey-reported values.

=========================================================
## TABLE 11: EDUCATION üêô

This table contains a set of indicators on the aspects of children‚Äôs education: equitable access, school completion and learning outcomes. This table first provides information about equitable access, as measured by the out-of-school children rate (SDG4.1.4). Estimates shown in this table were calculated using the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) database. The out-of-school children rate identifies the population part in the official age range for a given level of education not attending school, in order to formulate targeted policies that can be put in place to ensure equitable access to education.

===============================================
## TABLE 12. CHILD PROTECTION üêû

Child protection refers to the prevention of and response to violence, exploitation and abuse of children in all contexts. There are many violations that children can be subjected to, but the lack of comparable data limits reporting on the full spectrum. In view of this, the child protection table presents data on a few issues for which comparable and nationally representative data are available. This includes two manifestations of harmful traditional practices, some forms of violence and exploitation as well as the official recording of births.

===============================================
## TABLE 14. WASH üíê

This table contains a set of indicators on access to basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in households, schools and healthcare facilities. The WASH estimates in this report come from the WHO/ UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). Full details of the JMP indicator definitions, data sources and methods used to produce sub-national, national, regional and global estimates can be found at ",Kaggle

<p>CalWORKs is a welfare program that gives cash aid and services to eligible needy California families. The program serves all 58 counties in the state and is operated locally by county welfare departments. If a family has little or no cash and needs housing, food, utilities, clothing or medical care, they may be eligible to receive immediate short-term help. Families that apply and qualify for ongoing assistance receive benefits each month to help pay for housing, food and other necessary expenses. Monthly CalWORKs data is collected from the counties through submission of the <a href=""http://www.cdss.ca.gov/research/PG281.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">CA 237CW CalWORKs Cash Grant Movement Report</a>, which is used to report statistical information on CalWORKs caseload movement for Two Parent Families, Zero Parent Families, All Other Families, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Timed-Out Cases and Safety Net/Fleeing Felon/Long-Term Sanction Cases (SN/FF/LTS).</p>

COVID-19 Coronavirus data - weekly,COVID-19 Coronavirus data - weekly (from 17 December 2020),"### Content

The dataset contains a weekly situation update on COVID-19, the epidemiological curve and the global geographical distribution (EU/EEA and the UK, worldwide).

Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, ECDC‚Äôs Epidemic Intelligence team has collected the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, based on reports from health authorities worldwide. This comprehensive and systematic process was carried out on a daily basis until 14/12/2020. See the discontinued daily dataset: COVID-19 Coronavirus data - daily. ECDC‚Äôs decision to discontinue daily data collection is based on the fact that the daily number of cases reported or published by countries is frequently subject to retrospective corrections, delays in reporting and/or clustered reporting of data for several days. Therefore, the daily number of cases may not reflect the true number of cases at EU/EEA level at a given day of reporting. Consequently, day to day variations in the number of cases does not constitute a valid basis for policy decisions.

ECDC continues to monitor the situation. Every week between Monday and Wednesday, a team of epidemiologists screen up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures for publication on Thursday. The data screening is followed by ECDC‚Äôs standard epidemic intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database, complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then shared on the ECDC website, ensuring a maximum level of transparency.

ECDC receives regular updates from EU/EEA countries through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), The European Surveillance System (TESSy), the World Health Organization (WHO) and email exchanges with other international stakeholders. This information is complemented by screening up to 500 sources every day to collect COVID-19 figures from 196 countries. This includes websites of ministries of health (43% of the total number of sources), websites of public health institutes (9%), websites from other national authorities (ministries of social services and welfare, governments, prime minister cabinets, cabinets of ministries, websites on health statistics and official response teams) (6%), WHO websites and WHO situation reports (2%), and official dashboards and interactive maps from national and international institutions (10%). In addition, ECDC screens social media accounts maintained by national authorities on for example Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or Telegram accounts run by ministries of health (28%) and other official sources (e.g. official media outlets) (2%). Several media and social media sources are screened to gather additional information which can be validated with the official sources previously mentioned. Only cases and deaths reported by the national and regional competent authorities from the countries and territories listed are aggregated in our database.

Disclaimer: National updates are published at different times and in different time zones. This, and the time ECDC needs to process these data, might lead to discrepancies between the national numbers and the numbers published by ECDC. Users are advised to use all data with caution and awareness of their limitations. Data are subject to retrospective corrections; corrected datasets are released as soon as processing of updated national data has been completed.

<p>\3\Before 1999, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately, and students could not be classified as Two or more races.
