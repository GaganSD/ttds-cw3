# SemEval-2014 Task 4
## Task Description: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
 

Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed as a vital task both from an academic and a commercial standpoint. The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect the overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, regardless of the entities mentioned (e.g., laptops, restaurants) and their aspects (e.g., battery, screen; food, service). By contrast, this task is concerned with aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), where the goal is to identify the aspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. Datasets consisting of customer reviews with human-authored annotations identifying the mentioned aspects of the target entities and the sentiment polarity of each aspect will be provided.

 

In particular, the task consists of the following subtasks:


### Subtask 1: Aspect term extraction

Given a set of sentences with pre-identified entities (e.g., restaurants), identify the aspect terms present in the sentence and return a list containing all the distinct aspect terms. An aspect term names a particular aspect of the target entity.

 

For example, ""I liked the service and the staff, but not the food”, “The food was nothing much, but I loved the staff”. Multi-word aspect terms (e.g., “hard disk”) should be treated as single terms (e.g., in “The hard disk is very noisy” the only aspect term is “hard disk”).

### Subtask 2: Aspect term polarity

For a given set of aspect terms within a sentence, determine whether the polarity of each aspect term is positive, negative, neutral or conflict (i.e., both positive and negative).

 

For example:

“I loved their fajitas” → {fajitas: positive}
“I hated their fajitas, but their salads were great” → {fajitas: negative, salads: positive}
“The fajitas are their first plate” → {fajitas: neutral}
“The fajitas were great to taste, but not to see” → {fajitas: conflict}

### Subtask 3: Aspect category detection

Given a predefined set of aspect categories (e.g., price, food), identify the aspect categories discussed in a given sentence. Aspect categories are typically coarser than the aspect terms of Subtask 1, and they do not necessarily occur as terms in the given sentence.

 
For example, given the set of aspect categories {food, service, price, ambience, anecdotes/miscellaneous}:

“The restaurant was too expensive”  → {price}
“The restaurant was expensive, but the menu was great” → {price, food}

### Subtask 4: Aspect category polarity

Given a set of pre-identified aspect categories (e.g., {food, price}), determine the polarity (positive, negative, neutral or conflict) of each aspect category.

 

For example:

“The restaurant was too expensive” → {price: negative}
“The restaurant was expensive, but the menu was great” → {price: negative, food: positive}

 ---

### Datasets:

Two domain-specific datasets for laptops and restaurants, consisting of over 6K sentences with fine-grained aspect-level human annotations have been provided for training.

 

*Restaurant reviews*:

This dataset consists of over 3K English sentences from the restaurant reviews of Ganu et al. (2009). The original dataset of Ganu et al. included annotations for coarse aspect categories (Subtask 3) and overall sentence polarities; we modified the dataset to include annotations for aspect terms occurring in the sentences (Subtask 1), aspect term polarities (Subtask 2), and aspect category-specific polarities (Subtask 4). We also corrected some errors (e.g., sentence splitting errors) of the original dataset. Experienced human annotators identified the aspect terms of the sentences and their polarities (Subtasks 1 and 2). Additional restaurant reviews, not in the original dataset of Ganu et al. (2009), are being annotated in the same manner, and they will be used as test data. 

 

*Laptop reviews*:

This dataset consists of over 3K English sentences extracted from customer reviews of laptops. Experienced human annotators tagged the aspect terms of the sentences (Subtask 1) and their polarities (Subtask 2). This dataset will be used only for Subtasks 1 and 2. Part of this dataset will be reserved as test data. 

 

### Dataset format:

The sentences in the datasets are annotated using XML tags.

The following example illustrates the format of the annotated sentences of the restaurants dataset.
```xml

```
 

The possible values of the polarity field are: “positive”, “negative”, “conflict”, “neutral”. The possible values of the category field are: “food”, “service”, “price”, “ambience”, “anecdotes/miscellaneous”.

 

The following example illustrates the format of the annotated sentences of the laptops dataset. The format is the same as in the restaurant datasets, with the only exception that there are no annotations for aspect categories. Notice that we annotate only aspect terms naming particular aspects (e.g., “everything about it” does not name a particular aspect).

Chocolate Ratings,Reviews on more than 2400 chocolate bars!,"# About this dataset :chocolate_bar:
&gt; Chocolate is paramount in our society, it is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE) and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.

&gt; The first solid chocolate bar put into production was made by J. S. Fry & Sons of Bristol, England in 1847 and today it is estimated to be an **USD 130.56 billion dollar industry**.

&gt; In light of all of this, this dataset contains **reviews on more than 2400 different chocolate bars** along with metadata and information on US and Canadian based producers. A rating scale is provided and is defined as follows:
- 4.0 - 5.0 = Outstanding
- 3.5 - 3.9 = Highly Recommended
- 3.0 - 3.4 = Recommended
- 2.0 - 2.9 = Disappointing
- 1.0 - 1.9 = Unpleasant



# How to use this dataset
&gt; - Create a regression model to predict chocolate bar rating;
- Explore the most memorable features/ingredients associated with chocolate bars.

### About this dataset
&gt; <h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
<p>These data were used in the article <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/diet-affordability"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Three billion people cannot afford a healthy diet</a> published on <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Our World in Data</a> in July 2021.</p>
<p>This data is sourced from the work of <a href=""https://sites.tufts.edu/foodpricesfornutrition"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hereforth et al. (2020)</a>, which is a background paper for the UN FAO State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report. It is based on data on prices for locally available food items from the <a href=""https://icp.worldbank.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">World Bank's International Comparison Program (ICP)</a> attached to other data on food composition and dietary requirements.</p>
<p>The nutritional requirements used in this study are in line with the WHO's recommendations for the median woman of reproductive age. The authors note two key two reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requirements fall roughly at the median of the entire population distribution, in the sense that least-cost diets to meet energy and nutrient requirements for people in this reference group approximate the median level of least costs for all sex-age groups over the entire life cycle. This reference group is therefore a good representation of the population as a whole.</li>
<li>Women of reproductive age are typically a nutritionally vulnerable population group, as seen in their increased risk of dietary inadequacies (due to social practices and norms that often disadvantage them in terms of access to food), which have important consequences for themselves and their children. Previous studies have also based their analyses on this reference group.</li>

<h2><strong>Types of Diets</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><em>“Energy sufficient”</em> diets provide adequate calories for energy balance at a given level of physical activity and body size, using only the least-cost starchy staple in each country. For example, such a diet could consist of only the lowest cost type of rice in that country, or only maize porridge.</li>
<li><em>“Nutrient adequate”</em> diets provide not only adequate calories but also adequate levels of all essential nutrients – namely, carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals, within the upper and lower bounds needed to prevent deficiencies and avoid toxicity.</li>
<li><em>“Healthy”</em> diets meet a set of dietary recommendations intended to provide nutrient adequacy and long-term health. There are many definitions of a “healthy” diet pattern at national, regional and global levels. In this case, we select the national food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) of several countries from diverse regions, in order to represent a range of dietary recommendations which have been articulated by UN Member States. Dietary patterns have been studied extensively in the nutrition epidemiology literature, relating specific foods and proportionality of different food groups to disease incidence and prevention. Nutrients alone do not explain the relationship of food to health, as there are many non-nutrient components of food, including but not limited to fibre, phytochemicals, the food matrix, and interactions between these. FBDGs focus on foods rather than nutrients, and typically concentrate on proportionality of food group intake. Furthermore, proportionality in food group intake ensures a culturally acceptable diet meeting at least a minimum standard for palatability and cultural norms, so the healthy diet is closer to actual food preferences, in terms of dietary pattern, than the energy sufficient or nutrient adequate diets.</li>

Food Recognition 2022: Dataset,Detecting & Segmenting various kinds of food from an image,"
# 🍕 Food Recognition 2022

## Problem Statement

Detecting & Segmenting various kinds of food from an image. For ex. Someone got into new restaurent and get a food that he has never seen, well our DL model is in rescue, so our DL model will help indentifying which food it is from the class our model is being trained on!

## Dataset

We will be using data from Food Recognition Challenge - A benchmark for image-based food recognition challange which is running since 2020.

https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/food-recognition-benchmark-2022#datasets

We have a total of 39k training images with 3k validation set and 4k public-testing set. All the images are RGB and annotations exist in MS-COCO format.

## Evaluation

The evaluation metrics is IOU aka. Intersection Over Union ( more about that later ).

The actualy metric is computed by averaging over all the precision and recall values for IOU which greater than 0.5.
