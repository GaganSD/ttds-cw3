"Social Capital Contributions to Food Security: A Comprehensive
  Literature Review","  Social capital creates a synergy that benefits all members of a community.
This review examines how social capital contributes to the food security of
communities. A systematic literature review, based on Prisma, is designed to
provide a state-of-the-art review on capacity social capital in this realm. The
output of this method led to finding 39 related articles. Studying these
articles illustrates that social capital improves food security through two
mechanisms of knowledge sharing and product sharing (i.e., sharing food
products). It reveals that social capital through improving the food security
pillars (i.e., food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and
food system stability) affects food security. In other words, the interaction
among the community members results in sharing food products and information
among community members, which facilitates food availability and access to
food. There are many shreds of evidence in the literature that sharing food and
food products among the community member decreases household food security and
provides healthy nutrition to vulnerable families and improves the food
utilization pillar of food security. It is also disclosed that belonging to the
social networks increases the community members' resilience and decreases the
community's vulnerability that subsequently strengthens the stability of a food
system. This study contributes to the common literature on food security and
social capital by providing a conceptual model based on the literature. In
addition to researchers, policymakers can use this study's findings to provide
solutions to address food insecurity problems.

Machine Learning for Food Review and Recommendation,"  Food reviews and recommendations have always been important for online food
service websites. However, reviewing and recommending food is not simple as it
is likely to be overwhelmed by disparate contexts and meanings. In this paper,
we use different deep learning approaches to address the problems of sentiment
analysis, automatic review tag generation, and retrieval of food reviews. We
propose to develop a web-based food review system at Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) named NTU Food Hunter, which incorporates different deep
learning approaches that help users with food selection. First, we implement
the BERT and LSTM deep learning models into the system for sentiment analysis
of food reviews. Then, we develop a Part-of-Speech (POS) algorithm to
automatically identify and extract adjective-noun pairs from the review content
for review tag generation based on POS tagging and dependency parsing. Finally,
we also train a RankNet model for the re-ranking of the retrieval results to
improve the accuracy in our Solr-based food reviews search system. The
experimental results show that our proposed deep learning approaches are
promising for the applications of real-world problems.

"The Development and Applications of Food Knowledge Graphs in the Food
  Science and Industry","  The deployment of various networks (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile
networks), databases (e.g., nutrition tables and food compositional databases)
and social media (e.g., Instagram and Twitter) generates huge amounts of
multi-type food data, which plays critical roles in the food science and
industry. However, these multi-source food data appear as information silos due
to the well-known data harmonization problem, leading to the difficulty in
fully exploiting these food data. The food knowledge graph provides a unified
and standardized conceptual terminology and their relationships in a structured
form, and thus can transform food information silos to a more reusable globally
digitally connected Internet of Food to benefit various applications. To our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on food knowledge graphs in
the food science and industry. We first provide a brief introduction of
knowledge graphs, and then review the evolution of food knowledge organization
mainly from food classification, food ontology to food knowledge graphs.
Representative applications of food knowledge graphs will be summarized with
respect to new recipe development, food traceability, food data visualization,
personalized dietary recommendation, food search and question-answering, visual
food object recognition, and food machinery intelligent manufacturing. We also
discuss future directions in this field, such as food knowledge graphs for food
supply chain systems and human health, which deserve further study. Their great
potentials will attract more research efforts to apply food knowledge graphs
into the field of food science and industry.

Beyond water activity: recent advances based on an alternative approach to the assessment of food quality and safety.,"Water, the most abundant constituent of natural foods, is a ubiquitous plasticizer of most natural and fabricated food ingredients and products. Many of the new concepts and developments in modern food science and technology revolve around the role of water, and its manipulation, in food manufacturing, processing, and preservation. This article reviews the effects of water, as a near-universal solvent and plasticizer, on the behavior of polymeric (as well as oligomeric and monomeric) food materials and systems, with emphasis on the impact of water content (in terms of increasing system mobility and eventual water ""availability"") on food quality, safety, stability, and technological performance. This review describes a new perspective on moisture management, an old and established discipline now evolving to a theoretical basis of fundamental structure-property principles from the field of synthetic polymer science, including the innovative concepts of ""water dynamics"" and ""glass dynamics"". These integrated concepts focus on the non-equilibrium nature of all ""real world"" food products and processes, and stress the importance to successful moisture management of the maintenance of food systems in kinetically metastable, dynamically constrained glassy states rather than equilibrium thermodynamic phases. The understanding derived from this ""food polymer science"" approach to water relationships in foods has led to new insights and advances beyond the limited applicability of traditional concepts involving water activity. This article is neither a conventional nor comprehensive review of water activity, but rather a critical overview that presents and discusses current, usable information on moisture management theory, research, and practice applicable to food systems covering the broadest ranges of moisture content and processing/storage temperature conditions."
A Survey on Food Computing,"  Food is very essential for human life and it is fundamental to the human
experience. Food-related study may support multifarious applications and
services, such as guiding the human behavior, improving the human health and
understanding the culinary culture. With the rapid development of social
networks, mobile networks, and Internet of Things (IoT), people commonly
upload, share, and record food images, recipes, cooking videos, and food
diaries, leading to large-scale food data. Large-scale food data offers rich
knowledge about food and can help tackle many central issues of human society.
Therefore, it is time to group several disparate issues related to food
computing. Food computing acquires and analyzes heterogenous food data from
disparate sources for perception, recognition, retrieval, recommendation, and
monitoring of food. In food computing, computational approaches are applied to
address food related issues in medicine, biology, gastronomy and agronomy. Both
large-scale food data and recent breakthroughs in computer science are
transforming the way we analyze food data. Therefore, vast amounts of work has
been conducted in the food area, targeting different food-oriented tasks and
applications. However, there are very few systematic reviews, which shape this
area well and provide a comprehensive and in-depth summary of current efforts
or detail open problems in this area. In this paper, we formalize food
computing and present such a comprehensive overview of various emerging
concepts, methods, and tasks. We summarize key challenges and future directions
ahead for food computing. This is the first comprehensive survey that targets
the study of computing technology for the food area and also offers a
collection of research studies and technologies to benefit researchers and
practitioners working in different food-related fields.

AI-enabled Efficient and Safe Food Supply Chain,"  This paper provides a review of an emerging field in the food processing
sector, referring to efficient and safe food supply chains, from farm to fork,
as enabled by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent advances in machine and deep
learning are used for effective food production, energy management and food
labeling. Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this
purpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and
Recurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent
Variable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three
experimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI
methodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply
chain. In particular, these concern: (i) predicting plant growth and tomato
yield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and
reducing food waste or food unavailability; (ii) optimizing energy consumption
across large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal
selection of systems that can get shut-down and through prediction of the
respective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load; (iii)
optical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in
automatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and
people's health.

"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly Features: A Meta-analysis on User Review
  About Food Journaling Apps","  Users review about an app is a crucial component for open mobile application
market, such as the AppStore and the Google play. Analyzing these reviews can
reveal user's sentiment towards a feature in the app. There exist several
analytical tools to summarize user reviews and extract meaningful sense out of
them. However, these tools are still limited in terms of expressiveness and
accurately classifying the reviews into more than a positive and a negative
review. There is a need to get more insights from user app reviews and direct
it to future app development. In this paper, we present our result of analyzing
user reviews of 20 food journaling and health tracking apps. We gathered and
analyzed reviews per app and classified them into three distinct categories
using the sentiment treebank with recursive neural tensor network. We then
analyzed the vocabulary frequency per category using the Gensim implementation
of Word2Vec model. The analysis result clustered the reviews into good, bad and
ugly feature reviews. Different usage patterns were detected from users review.
We identified major reasons why users express a certain sentiment towards an
app and learned how users' satisfaction or complaints was related to a specific
feature. This research could be a guideline for app developers to follow when
developing an app to refrain from adopting techniques that might demotivate
(hinder) the application use or adopt those perceived positively by the users.
