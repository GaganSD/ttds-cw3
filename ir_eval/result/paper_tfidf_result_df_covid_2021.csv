"Explainable AI Framework for COVID-19 Prediction in Different Provinces
  of India","  In 2020, covid-19 virus had reached more than 200 countries. Till December
20th 2021, 221 nations in the world had collectively reported 275M confirmed
cases of covid-19 & total death toll of 5.37M. Many countries which include
United States, India, Brazil, United Kingdom, Russia etc were badly affected by
covid-19 pandemic due to the large population. The total confirmed cases
reported in this country are 51.7M, 34.7M, 22.2M, 11.3M, 10.2M respectively
till December 20, 2021. This pandemic can be controlled with the help of
precautionary steps by government & civilians of the country. The early
prediction of covid-19 cases helps to track the transmission dynamics & alert
the government to take the necessary precautions. Recurrent Deep learning
algorithms is a data driven model which plays a key role to capture the
patterns present in time series data. In many literatures, the Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) based model are proposed for the efficient prediction of COVID-19
cases for different provinces. The study in the literature doesnt involve the
interpretation of the model behavior & robustness. In this study, The LSTM
model is proposed for the efficient prediction of active cases in each
provinces of India. The active cases dataset for each province in India is
taken from John Hopkins publicly available dataset for the duration from 10th
June, 2020 to 4th August, 2021. The proposed LSTM model is trained on one state
i.e., Maharashtra and tested for rest of the provinces in India. The concept of
Explainable AI is involved in this study for the better interpretation &
understanding of the model behavior. The proposed model is used to forecast the
active cases in India from 16th December, 2021 to 5th March, 2022. It is
notated that there will be a emergence of third wave on January, 2022 in India.

Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine and Its Determinants in Bangladesh,"  Background: Bangladesh govt. launched a nationwide vaccination drive against
SARS-CoV-2 infection from early February 2021. The objectives of this study
were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the
factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh.
  Method: In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based
anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. The
multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that
influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination.
  Results: 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the
COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness
to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the
vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine's efficacy and safety or
COVID-19 become deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age,
gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of
being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection,
having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge
about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the
acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.
  Conclusion: The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine
refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and
increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched
immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine
acceptance among people, false rumors and misconceptions about the COVID-19
vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be
exposed to the actual scientific facts.

"MMCoVaR: Multimodal COVID-19 Vaccine Focused Data Repository for Fake
  News Detection and a Baseline Architecture for Classification","  The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in an ""infodemic"" that has encouraged
the propagation of misinformation about COVID-19 and cure methods which, in
turn, could negatively affect the adoption of recommended public health
measures in the larger population. In this paper, we provide a new multimodal
(consisting of images, text and temporal information) labeled dataset
containing news articles and tweets on the COVID-19 vaccine. We collected 2,593
news articles from 80 publishers for one year between Feb 16th 2020 to May 8th
2021 and 24184 Twitter posts (collected between April 17th 2021 to May 8th
2021). We combine ratings from two news media ranking sites: Medias Bias Chart
and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) to classify the news dataset into two levels
of credibility: reliable and unreliable. The combination of two filters allows
for higher precision of labeling. We also propose a stance detection mechanism
to annotate tweets into three levels of credibility: reliable, unreliable and
inconclusive. We provide several statistics as well as other analytics like,
publisher distribution, publication date distribution, topic analysis, etc. We
also provide a novel architecture that classifies the news data into
misinformation or truth to provide a baseline performance for this dataset. We
find that the proposed architecture has an F-Score of 0.919 and accuracy of
0.882 for fake news detection. Furthermore, we provide benchmark performance
for misinformation detection on tweet dataset. This new multimodal dataset can
be used in research on COVID-19 vaccine, including misinformation detection,
influence of fake COVID-19 vaccine information, etc.

"Projecting the Impact of Covid-19 Variants and Vaccination Strategies in
  Disease Transmission using a Multilayer Network Model in Costa Rica","  For countries starting to receive steady supplies of vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2, the course of Covid-19 for the following months will be determined
by the emergence of new variants and successful roll-out of vaccination
campaigns. To anticipate this scenario, we used a multilayer network model
developed to forecast the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in Costa Rica, and
to estimate the impact of the introduction of the Delta variant in the country,
under two plausible vaccination scenarios, one sustaining Costa Rica's July
2021 vaccination pace of 30,000 doses per day and with high acceptance from the
population and another with declining vaccination pace to 13,000 doses per day
and with lower acceptance. Results suggest that the introduction and gradual
dominance of the Delta variant would increase Covid-19 hospitalizations and ICU
admissions between $35\%$ and $33.25\%$, from August 2021 to December 2021,
depending on vaccine administration and acceptance. In the presence of the
Delta variant, new Covid-19 hospitalizations and ICU admission would experience
an average increase of $24.26\%$ and $27.19\%$ respectively in the same period
if the vaccination pace drops. Our results can help decision-makers better
prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic in the months to come.

"Bayesian hypothesis testing and hierarchical modelling of ivermectin
  effectiveness in treating Covid-19","  Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that some have claimed is an effective
treatment for reducing Covid-19 deaths. To test this claim, two recent peer
reviewed papers both conducted a meta-analysis on a similar set of randomized
controlled trials data, applying the same classical statistical approach.
Although the statistical results were similar, one of the papers (Bryant et al,
2021) concluded that ivermectin was effective for reducing Covid-19 deaths,
while the other (Roman et al, 2021) concluded that there was insufficient
quality of evidence to support the conclusion Ivermectin was effective. This
paper applies a Bayesian approach, to a subset of the same trial data, to test
several causal hypotheses linking Covid-19 severity and ivermectin to mortality
and produce an alternative analysis to the classical approach. Applying diverse
alternative analysis methods which reach the same conclusions should increase
overall confidence in the result. We show that there is strong evidence to
support a causal link between ivermectin, Covid-19 severity and mortality, and:
i) for severe Covid-19 there is a 90.7% probability the risk ratio favours
ivermectin; ii) for mild/moderate Covid-19 there is an 84.1% probability the
risk ratio favours ivermectin. To address concerns expressed about the veracity
of some of the studies we evaluate the sensitivity of the conclusions to any
single study by removing one study at a time. In the worst case, where
(Elgazzar 2020) is removed, the results remain robust, for both severe and mild
to moderate Covid-19. The paper also highlights advantages of using Bayesian
methods over classical statistical methods for meta-analysis. All studies
included in the analysis were prior to data on the delta variant.

"COVID-19 Diagnosis from Cough Acoustics using ConvNets and Data
  Augmentation","  With the periodic rise and fall of COVID-19 and countries being inflicted by
its waves, an efficient, economic, and effortless diagnosis procedure for the
virus has been the utmost need of the hour. COVID-19 positive individuals may
even be asymptomatic making the diagnosis difficult, but amongst the infected
subjects, the asymptomatic ones need not be entirely free of symptoms caused by
the virus. They might not show any observable symptoms like the symptomatic
subjects, but they may differ from uninfected ones in the way they cough. These
differences in the coughing sounds are minute and indiscernible to the human
ear, however, these can be captured using machine learning-based statistical
models. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to analyze the
acoustic dataset provided in Track 1 of the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge containing
cough sound recordings belonging to both COVID-19 positive and negative
examples. To perform the classification on the sound recordings as belonging to
a COVID-19 positive or negative examples, we propose a ConvNet model. Our model
achieved an AUC score percentage of 72.23 on the blind test set provided by the
same for an unbiased evaluation of the models. The ConvNet model incorporated
with Data Augmentation further increased the AUC-ROC percentage from 72.23 to
87.07. It also outperformed the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge's baseline model by 23%
thus, claiming the top position on the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge leaderboard. This
paper proposes the use of Mel frequency cepstral coefficients as the feature
input for the proposed model.

"The effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on self-reported depression and
  anxiety during February 2021","  Using the COVID-19 Trends and Impacts Survey (CTIS), we examine the effect of
COVID-19 vaccinations on (self-reported) feelings of depression and anxiety
(""depression""), isolation, and worries about health, among vaccine-accepting
survey respondents during February 2021. Assuming no unmeasured confounding, we
estimate that vaccinations caused a -4.3 (-4.7, -3.8), -3.4 (-3.9, -2.9), and
-4.8 (-5.4, -4.1) percentage point change in these outcomes, respectively. We
further argue that these effects provide a lower bound on the mental health
burden of the pandemic, implying that the COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for
at least a 28.6 (25.3, 31.9) percent increase in feelings of depression and a
20.5 (17.3, 23.6) percent increase in feelings of isolation during February
2021 among vaccine-accepting CTIS survey respondents. We also posit a model
where vaccinations affect depression through worries about health and feelings
of isolation, and estimate the proportion mediated by each pathway. We find
that feelings of social isolation is the stronger mediator, accounting for 41.0
(37.3, 44.7) percent of the total effect, while worries about health accounts
for 9.4 (7.6, 11.1) percent of the total effect. We caution that the causal
interpretation of these findings rests on strong assumptions. Nevertheless, as
the pandemic continues, policymakers should also target interventions aimed at
managing the substantial mental health burden associated with the COVID-19
pandemic.

"COVID-19 Vaccine and Social Media: Exploring Emotions and Discussions on
  Twitter","  The understanding of the public response to COVID-19 vaccines is the key
success factor to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the public
response, there is a need to explore public opinion. Traditional surveys are
expensive and time-consuming, address limited health topics, and obtain
small-scale data. Twitter can provide a great opportunity to understand public
opinion regarding COVID-19 vaccines. The current study proposes an approach
using computational and human coding methods to collect and analyze a large
number of tweets to provide a wider perspective on the COVID-19 vaccine. This
study identifies the sentiment of tweets using a machine learning rule-based
approach, discovers major topics, explores temporal trend and compares topics
of negative and non-negative tweets using statistical tests, and discloses top
topics of tweets having negative and non-negative sentiment. Our findings show
that the negative sentiment regarding the COVID-19 vaccine had a decreasing
trend between November 2020 and February 2021. We found Twitter users have
discussed a wide range of topics from vaccination sites to the 2020 U.S.
election between November 2020 and February 2021. The findings show that there
was a significant difference between tweets having negative and non-negative
sentiment regarding the weight of most topics. Our results also indicate that
the negative and non-negative tweets had different topic priorities and
focuses. This research illustrates that Twitter data can be used to explore
public opinion regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.

"Associational and plausible causal effects of COVID-19 public health
  policies on economic and mental distress","  Background The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental distress globally. The
proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.
Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19
cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different
mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.
Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021
data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.
We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:
COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public
policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic
and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent
variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path
coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to
February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the
U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies
where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19
cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the
same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental
distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity
decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential
causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression
is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case
information, behavior, and economic distress may be causally associated with
pandemic related period t mental distress.

"The African School of Fundamental Physics and Applications Activity
  Report 2019-2021","  The sixth edition of the African School of Fundamental and Applied Physics
(ASP) was planned for Morocco in July 2020 and was referred to as ASP2020.
Preparations were at an advanced stage when ASP2020 was postponed because of
the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-week event was restructured into two
activities in 2021 -- an online event on July 19-30, 2021 and a hybrid event on
December 12-18, 2021 -- and was renamed ASP2021. At the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, an online lecture series was integrated into the ASP
activities. The ASP mentorship program, which consists of online engagements
between lecturers and assigned mentees, continued in this way. ASP alumni
studied one year of COVID-19 data of ten African countries to offer insights
into pandemic containment measures. In this note, we report on ASP activities
since the last in-person edition of ASP in 2018 in Namibia.
