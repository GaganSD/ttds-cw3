Anaphylaxis after ingestion of carmine colored foods: two case reports and a review of the literature.,"Two patients with adverse food reactions to foods colored with carmine dye are presented, along with a review of the medical literature addressing adverse reactions to carmine colorant. This review summarizes the mounting evidence suggesting that adverse reactions to carmine colorant are the result of an IgE mediated mechanism.",pubmed-10624494

Position of the American Dietetic Association: food irradiation.,"Food irradiation has been identified a sa safe technology to reduce the risk of foodborne illness as part of high-quality food production, processing, handling, and preparation. Food irradiation's history of scientific research , evaluation, and testing spans more than 40 countries around the world and it has been endorsed or support by numerous national and international food and organizations and professional groups. Food irradiation utilizes a source of ionizing energy that passes through food to destroy harmful bacteria and other organism. Often referred to as ""cold pasteurization,"" food irradiation offers negligible loss of nutrients or sensory qualities in food as it does not substantially raise the temperature of the food during processing. Food irradiation does not replace proper food production, processing, handling, or preparation, nor can it enhance the quality of or prevent contact with foodborne bacteria after irradiation. In the United States, manufacturers are required to identify irradiated food sold to consumers with an international symbol (Radura) and and terminology describing the process on product labels. In addiction, food irradiation facilities are thoroughly regulated and monitored for worker and environmental safety. Members of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) and other food, nutrition, and health professionals have a responsibility to educate consumers, food processors, manufacturers and retailers about the safety and application of the technology. When consumers are educated about food irradiation, many prefer irradiated products because of their increased safety. It is the position of ADA that food irradiation enhances the safety and quality of the food supply and helps protect consumers from foodborne illness. The ADA encourages the government, food manufactures, food commodity groups, and qualified food and nutrition professionals to work together to educate consumers about this additional food safety tool and make this choice available in the marketplace.",pubmed-10670403
Food ads on TV: a health hazard for children?,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the nutritional quality of food in television food advertisements that are targeted at children.


METHOD
We videotaped 42 hours of children's programs and analysed the food advertisements' content and nutrient composition using the New Zealand Food Composition Database.


RESULTS
Of 269 food advertisements, 63% were for foods 'high in fat and/or sugar'. Children who ate only the advertised foods would eat a diet too high in fat, saturated fat, protein, free sugars and sodium. Furthermore, their diets would have suboptimal levels of fibre and suboptimal intakes of a number of important micronutrients (depending on age), including magnesium, selenium and vitamin E. The food products advertised on this channel rarely included nutritious low-cost foods that are necessary for food security in low-income groups. There were also no food advertisements that included any of the healthy foods consumed by Maori and Pacific peoples.


CONCLUSIONS
Food advertisements targeted at children generally reflect the dietary pattern associated with an increased risk of obesity and dental caries in childhood; and cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers in adulthood.",pubmed-10641359
Food allergy: when and how to perform oral food challenges.,"In many situations, the diagnosis of food allergy rests simply upon a history of an acute onset of typical symptoms, such as hives and wheezing, following the isolated ingestion of a suspected food, with confirmatory laboratory studies of positive prick skin tests or Radioallergosorbent tests. However, the diagnosis is more complicated when multiple foods are implicated or when chronic diseases, such as asthma or atopic dermatitis, are evaluated. The diagnosis of food allergy and identification of the particular foods responsible is also more difficult when reactions are not mediated by IgE antibody, as is the case with a number of gastrointestinal food allergies. In these latter circumstances, well-devised elimination diets followed by physician-supervised oral food challenges are critical in the identification and proper treatment of these disorders. Because childhood food allergies to common allergenic foods such as milk, egg, wheat and soy are usually outgrown, oral food challenges are also an integral part of the long-term management of these children.",pubmed-10678717
Food conditioning is impaired in cats deprived of the taste of food in early life.,"Cats were fed by stomach tube during the first 75 days of their life. Thus, they were deprived of the taste of food and the food reward. The cats were then trained to find food behind the gate. They acquired this simple response very slowly and during the first weeks of training they often refused to eat the food reward. Moreover, they extinguished the response poorly. We conclude that the deprived cats did not originally perceive the food reward as attractive, but they were able to learn this, and they were poorly able to form both excitatory and inhibitory food conditioned connections.",pubmed-10688061

Diet self-selection and food hoarding after food deprivation by Siberian hamsters.,"Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) increase food hoarding, but not food intake, after a fast. Because the physiological mechanisms underlying these changes in food hoarding are virtually unknown, we sought insight into these mechanisms by allowing hamsters to self-select their diet from food sources varying in macronutrient composition and caloric density (""dietary wisdom""). Therefore, the effects of food deprivation length on diet self-selection were tested in adult female hamsters after adaptation to three composite diets: sunflower seeds (SS), pellet chow (PC), and rabbit chow (RC). One group initially was fasted for 32 h, the other for 56 h, and then each was refed. The remaining nonexperienced fast was instated after prefast body mass, food intake, and hoarding were recovered. Food hoarding, but not food intake, was increased regardless of fast length or sequence; moreover, the largest increase in food hoarding was on the first day of refeeding and was primarily reflected as increased SS hoarding. When the longer fast occurred first body mass loss was greater and the increased food hoard size was maintained for more days than when the longer fast came second. The order of food intake and hoarding preferences was not changed after a fast (SS > PC > RC), but the degree of food hoarding preference for SS was exaggerated. Collectively, these results support the notion that food hoarding increases with decreases in lipid stores, and show that when internal lipid stores are decreased, external lipid stores are preferentially increased.",pubmed-10627080
Intracerebroventricular injection of orexins does not stimulate food intake in neonatal chicks.,"1. Recently, 2 novel neuropeptides were discovered, both derived from the same precursor by proteolytic processing, which bind and activate 2 closely related orphan G protein-coupled receptors, Named orexin-A and -B (Sakurai et al., 1998). Both stimulate food intake when administered centrally to rats. 2. Our aim was to elucidate whether central injection of mammalian orexin-A or -B stimulates food intake in the chick. 3. Under conditions of free access to food, orexin-A did not alter the food intake of chicks, but cumulative food intake was significantly suppressed by orexin-B. 4. The orexin-B was then administered to chicks deprived of food for 3 h to confirm its suppressive effect. No significant effect of orexin-B on food intake was detected. 5. Central injection of orexin-B did not modify food intake when appetite was stimulated by fasting. 6. Neither of these orexins appears to stimulate feeding in chicks.",pubmed-10670685
"Response to changes in food palatability in tufted capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella.","Palatability of plant foods may change over time in relation to the concentration of toxic secondary metabolites. We investigated the behavioural response of capuchin monkeys to this type of change and assessed the influence of social conditions. Twenty-seven tufted capuchin monkeys were presented in Social or Individual conditions with a familiar palatable food (phase 1), with the same familiar food to which pepper had been added, making it unpalatable (phase 2), and with the same familiar palatable food of phase 1 (phase 3). Five sessions were carried out in each phase. The capuchins adapted quickly to the change in food palatability by reducing (phase 2) and increasing (phase 3) the amounts of food eaten. The unpalatable food prompted an increase in olfactory exploration and in food processing. The experimental conditions (Social versus Individual) did not influence consumption, or any of the other behaviours. In addition, capuchins were more often near subjects with food in phases 2 and 3 in which palatability changed than in phase 1. These findings show that capuchins readily adjust to changes in flavour and palatability of a familiar food and that sudden unpalatability has no carry-over effects. Therefore, capuchins behave differently towards a familiar food whose palatability has changed than they do towards novel foods.
