"The Development and Applications of Food Knowledge Graphs in the Food
  Science and Industry",,,"  The deployment of various networks (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile
networks), databases (e.g., nutrition tables and food compositional databases)
and social media (e.g., Instagram and Twitter) generates huge amounts of
multi-type food data, which plays critical roles in the food science and
industry. However, these multi-source food data appear as information silos due
to the well-known data harmonization problem, leading to the difficulty in
fully exploiting these food data. The food knowledge graph provides a unified
and standardized conceptual terminology and their relationships in a structured
form, and thus can transform food information silos to a more reusable globally
digitally connected Internet of Food to benefit various applications. To our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on food knowledge graphs in
the food science and industry. We first provide a brief introduction of
knowledge graphs, and then review the evolution of food knowledge organization
mainly from food classification, food ontology to food knowledge graphs.
Representative applications of food knowledge graphs will be summarized with
respect to new recipe development, food traceability, food data visualization,
personalized dietary recommendation, food search and question-answering, visual
food object recognition, and food machinery intelligent manufacturing. We also
discuss future directions in this field, such as food knowledge graphs for food
supply chain systems and human health, which deserve further study. Their great
potentials will attract more research efforts to apply food knowledge graphs
into the field of food science and industry.
