Determination of additives in food by capillary electrophoresis.,"The application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) to the analysis of additives in food has been reviewed. Additives included in the review are preservatives, antioxidants, sweeteners, colourings, caffeine, niacin, choline, nitrate, and nitrite. The review highlights the versatility of CE in separating this often widely disparate group of compounds. The application of the methods to real food samples is also discussed.",p
Diet and prevention of colorectal cancer.,"There is a 20-fold difference in incidence rates of colorectal cancer between the areas of highest incidence (North America and Australia) and lowest incidence (India). Animal studies, epidemiologic research, and clinical trials continue to focus on diet in the search for responsible environmental factors. Between 1997 and 1999, a number of research areas have had considerable activity, and they provide the focus for this review. Among foods, vegetables, cereals, and soy have been topics of recent research. Nutrients from foods and supplements have also gained attention, including n-3 fatty acids, calcium, and B vitamins. Gene-environment interactions are beginning to be studied in populations. Studies of the interaction between polymorphisms in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and dietary components for risk of both colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps provide a glimpse into the future of diet and cancer research.",p

The $22 billion program provides financial support to 14 million persons (including more than 9 million children). The changing character of the family structure is considered in terms of efforts to control AFDC spending. Additional programs to assist children (Social Security, Supplemental Security Insurance and Food Stamps) are reviewed.",p
An overview of the regulatory aspects of medical devices from the viewpoint of research and device manufacturing.,"PURPOSE
To review the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory requirements for bringing a new or substantially changed medical device to market in the United States, noting the history and current requirements for the continuous spinal catheter.


METHOD
The relevant laws and guidelines for classifying, testing, and submitting a device to Food and Drug Administration approval are reviewed.


RESULTS
The Food and Drug Administration categorizes medical devices into three classes, based on potential risk for illness or injury presented by a malfunction or failure. Class III devices are the most critical ones, and require a Premarket Approval that includes clinical trials before market introduction. Classes I and II usually require a 510(k), or premarket notification, which usually does not need any clinical data. Testing requirements include biocompatibility testing; physical, functional, and packaging testing; and sterility testing. The continuous spinal catheter (25-32 gauge) was marketed under a 510(k) claiming substantial equivalence to the Bizzarri-Giuffrida 24-gauge catheter, which was a pre-Amendment device. After incidences of cauda equina syndrome were reported with use of the continuous spinal technique, the Food and Drug Administration reclassified the small-gauge catheters as Class III devices, which require a Premarket Approval before being marketed.",p
Application of cereals and cereal components in functional foods: a review.,"The food industry is directing new product development towards the area of functional foods and functional food ingredients due to consumers' demand for healthier foods. In this respect, probiotic dairy foods containing human-derived Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species and prebiotic food formulations containing ingredients that cannot be digested by the human host in the upper gastrointestinal tract and can selectively stimulate the growth of one or a limited number of colonic bacteria have been recently introduced into the market. The aim of these products is to affect beneficially the gut microbial composition and activities. Cereals offer another alternative for the production of functional foods. The multiple beneficial effects of cereals can be exploited in different ways leading to the design of novel cereal foods or cereal ingredients that can target specific populations. Cereals can be used as fermentable substrates for the growth of probiotic microorganisms. The main parameters that have to be considered are the composition and processing of the cereal grains, the substrate formulation, the growth capability and productivity of the starter culture, the stability of the probiotic strain during storage, the organoleptic properties and the nutritional value of the final product. Additionally, cereals can be used as sources of nondigestible carbohydrates that besides promoting several beneficial physiological effects can also selectively stimulate the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria present in the colon and act as prebiotics. Cereals contain water-soluble fibre, such as beta-glucan and arabinoxylan, oilgosaccharides, such as galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides and resistant starch, which have been suggested to fulfil the prebiotic concept. Separation of specific fractions of fibre from different cereal varieties or cereal by-products, according to the knowledge of fibre distribution in cereal grains, could be achieved through processing technologies, such as milling, sieving, and debranning or pearling. Finally, cereal constituents, such as starch, can be used as encapsulation materials for probiotics in order to improve their stability during storage and enhance their viability during their passage through the adverse conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. It could be concluded that functional foods based on cereals is a challenging perspective, however, the development of new technologies of cereal processing that enhance their health potential and the acceptability of the food product are of primary importance.",p

Five-year interim comparison of the Guidant bifurcated endograft with open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"OBJECTIVE
This study was undertaken to compare 1-year and 5-year results of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with the Guidant/EVT bifurcated graft system with results of open repair.


METHODS
This was a prospective, nonrandomized, concurrent controlled study that compared results of endovascular versus open repair of AAA. The Phase II study with the EGS delivery system included 268 patients in 18 US medical centers; and the Phase III trial with the Ancure delivery system incuded 305 patients in 21 US institutions. Data were internally and externally audited and subjected to periodic review by the US Food and Drug Administration. The control group of 111 patients were excluded from endovascular repair with a tube graft because of anatomic considerations, but were otherwise comparable to the experimental group. Patients in the control group underwent conventional open surgical repair concurrently with patients who underwent EGS repair in 18 US institutions.


RESULTS
Five hundred thirty-one of 573 patients (92.7%) underwent successful implantation of the Guidant/EVT bifurcated endograft. The combined major morbidity and mortality in the endograft group was 28.8%, compared with 44.1% in the open control group. Additional benefits in the endograft group included shorter hospital stay (2 days vs 6 days), less surgical blood loss (400 mL vs 800 mL), and less intensive care unit use (33% vs 94%). These early results are reported on an intent-to-treat basis; in all patients an attempt was made to treat with the endovascular graft, including those patients in whom conversion to standard open repair was necessary during the primary procedure. Three hundred nineteen patients were selected for long-term follow-up to 5 years, on the basis of date of implantation; ie, patients with the earliest implantations were followed up for 5 years. The primary purpose of long-term follow-up was to obtain data on long-term efficacy of the graft; thus only patients in whom implantation was successful were selected. No patient has experienced an aneurysm rupture to date. Survival (Kaplan- Meier method) in the experimental group was 68.1%, compared with 77.2% in the control group (P = NS). At 60 months, 74.4% of patients (32 of 43) were free of endoleak. There were no type I or type III endoleaks remaining. Aneurysm sac diameter decreased or remained stable in 97.6% of patients (41 of 42) and increased in only 1 patient. During the course of long-term follow-up, post-procedural conversion to open repair was required in only 9 patients (2.8%).


CONCLUSION
The EVT/Guidant bifurcated graft is effective in preventing AAA rupture, and long-term survival is comparable to that with open repair.",p
Direct plating technique for enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes in foods.,"The advantages and disadvantages of various techniques for detecting and enumerating Listeria monocytogenes in foods are reviewed, and results from a study designed to compare 14 direct plating media for their suitability to recover uninjured cells of L. monocytogenes from 4 foods are summarized. McBride Listeria agar (MLA), gum base nalidixic acid tryptone soy agar (GBNTSA), modified Despierres agar (MDA), and modified MLA (MMLA) performed best for recovering all inoculum populations from milk and ice cream mix. For Brie cheese, MLA, MDA, MMLA, and Dominguez Rodriguez isolation agar were superior for recovering L. monocytogenes; GBNTSA, MDA, MMLA, and Donnelly's Listeria enrichment agar were best for recovering the organism from cabbage. Direct plating procedures without prior enrichment can be utilized successfully for recovering L. monocytogenes from foods such as pasteurized milk and ice cream mix, which contain low populations of background microflora. However, recovery of L. monocytogenes from foods such as raw cabbage and Brie cheese, which contain high populations of other microorganisms, was not satisfactory using direct plating procedures.",p
Detection of Salmonella in dry foods using refrigerated pre-enrichment and enrichment broth cultures: interlaboratory study.,"An interlaboratory study was performed in 11 laboratories to validate the use of pre-enrichment and tetrathionate brilliant green (TBG35) and selenite cystine (SC35) enrichment cultures refrigerated 72 h at 2-5 degrees C for greater analytical flexibility in the detection of Salmonella in dry foods. Productivities of refrigerated pre-enrichment and enrichment cultures were compared with that of the AOAC/Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) procedure using 4 food types: whole egg powder, milk chocolate, animal feed, and instantized skim milk powder. Uninoculated and inoculated samples were included in each food group. There was complete agreement between the results obtained by the standard AOAC/BAM procedure and the 2 refrigeration procedures. Of 660 samples tested, the AOAC/BAM procedure identified 393 contaminated samples that were readily detected from the corresponding refrigerated pre-enrichment cultures and from the combined productivity of homologous refrigerated TBG35 and SC35 cultures. Refrigeration (72 h) of pre-enrichment or enrichment cultures for greater analytical flexibility and laboratory productivity in the examination of dry foods is under review for adoption by AOAC International.",p
Management of dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient.,"Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in high-risk patients. The identification and treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), suggest that patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > or =130 mg/dL, and perhaps even those with levels > or =100 mg/dL, should receive drug therapy. Optimal LDL-C levels have been set at <100 mg/dL and <115 mg/dL for high-risk patients by US and European guidelines, respectively. However, a recent survey shows that only about 20% of high-risk patients currently meet these goals. In order to achieve therapeutic targets for LDL-C, the statins are the foundation of treatment, as they are the most effective and best-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapeutic options include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols, although seldom as monotherapy. Combination therapy with a statin and one of these other lipid-lowering agents can be useful in patients who are unable to achieve target lipid levels through monotherapy. There remains, however, a need for additional agents. Some of the new options for reducing LDL-C levels that may be available in the near future include 2 new statins, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin, which is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C than atorvastatin over its full dose range. In comparative clinical trials, it has also enabled more patients with primary hypercholesterolemia to meet lipid goals than atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Inhibitors of bile acid transport or cholesterol absorption may also have therapeutic value. The first cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, which has just been approved by the FDA, appears to be most effective when combined with a statin. It is anticipated that such new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality of CHD.",p
Shelf life prediction: status and future possibilities.,"Although there is rapid progress in the field of chemical detection technology, little of this technology appears to have found application in estimation of the remaining shelf life of foods and early detection of spoilage. Predictive microbiology aims to summarise the probable behaviour of specific spoilage organisms and the progression of spoilage processes in foods. The quantitative knowledge generated in the field of predictive microbiology provides a sound basis for the rational development of devices with which to monitor loss of product shelf life during storage, distribution and retail sale. To predict remaining shelf life accurately it is necessary, however, to consider the microbial ecology of the food system. Aspects of microbial ecology and physiology relevant to the spoilage of foods are briefly reviewed and the potential benefits of the use of predictive microbiology in shelf life estimation are described. These points are exemplified by reference to a modelling program undertaken to develop, validate and 'package' in an easily useable from, models of the effect of temperature, water activity and pH on the growth rate of psychrotrophic spoilage pseudomonads. Necessary properties of devices to monitor loss of shelf life are discussed. 'Bioindicators' are identified as potential monitors of spoilage and suggestions made for their development based on the concept of 'upper limiting bacterial growth' rates, for which preliminary evidence is presented.",p
Food and microbiological problems in the newborn: data and practice.,"We have reviewed the relationships of food, nutrition and feeding practices to various infections in the newborn. Tentative conclusions are made: (a) the initial use of human milk (raw or pasteurized) continues to offer advantages in the care of babies in intensive care; (b) attempts to mimic the microbiological effects of breast milk by manipulation of the composition of infant formulas have so far achieved little success, but this is a rapidly developing field; (c) we are wary of the widespread use of breast milk ""fortifiers"" until there is evidence that they do not adversely affect the protective properties of breast milk; (d) the doubtful advantages of nasojejunal feeding need to be weighed against the increased bacterial contamination of the upper small bowel; (e) systems monitoring in milk kitchens and the handling of feeds in the neonatal unit are an integral part of comprehensive neonatal care; (f) to limit nosocomial infection, particular attention to the faecal-food-oral route is necessary since there is potential for multiplication of initial contamination of food.",p
Application of the assay of aflatoxins by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection in food analysis.,HPLC using fluorescence detection has already become the most accepted method for the determination of aflatoxins due to its several advantages over other analytical methods. Both normal- and reversed-phase HPLC can be used. However the reversed-phase HPLC methods are more popular. Liquid chromatographic determination of aflatoxins using fluorescence detection and its application in food analysis is reviewed in this article.,p
"Food cravings, endogenous opioid peptides, and food intake: a review.","Extensive research indicates a strong relationship between endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) and food intake. In the present paper, we propose that food cravings act as an intervening variable in this opioid-ingestion link. Specifically, we argue that altered EOP activity may elicit food cravings which in turn may influence food consumption. Correlational support for this opioidergic theory of food cravings is provided by examining various clinical conditions (e.g. pregnancy, menstruation, bulimia, stress, depression) which are associated with altered EOP levels, intensified food cravings, and increased food intake.",p
Sources of N-nitrosamine contamination in foods.,"It has been well established that human foods may contain trace amounts of carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Originally, it was thought that the use of nitrite as a curing agent for flesh foods was the major source of these trace compounds in the diet. Subsequent research has clearly shown that other processing and packaging procedures can also introduce trace amounts of these carcinogens into foods. These procedures include drying foods in direct flame heated air, migration from food contact surfaces and direct addition as contaminants. In addition, other reports of N-nitrosamines in foods have less well defined routes of contamination. These sources of N-nitrosamines in foods will each be briefly reviewed in this paper and recent data from our laboratory concerning N-nitrosamines in products which directly contact foods presented. We also are reporting the N-nitrosothiazolidine content of fried-out bacon fat.",p
Human exposure and internal dose assessments of acrylamide in food.,"This review provides a framework contributing to the risk assessment of acrylamide in food. It is based on the outcome of the ILSI Europe FOSIE process, a risk assessment framework for chemicals in foods and adds to the overall framework by focusing especially on exposure assessment and internal dose assessment of acrylamide in food. Since the finding that acrylamide is formed in food during heat processing and preparation of food, much effort has been (and still is being) put into understanding its mechanism of formation, on developing analytical methods and determination of levels in food, and on evaluation of its toxicity and potential toxicity and potential human health consequences. Although several exposure estimations have been proposed, a systematic review of key information relevant to exposure assessment is currently lacking. The European and North American branches of the International Life Sciences Institute, ILSI, discussed critical aspects of exposure assessment, parameters influencing the outcome of exposure assessment and summarised data relevant to the acrylamide exposure assessment to aid the risk characterisation process. This paper reviews the data on acrylamide levels in food including its formation and analytical methods, the determination of human consumption patterns, dietary intake of the general population, estimation of maximum intake levels and identification of groups of potentially high intakes. Possible options and consequences of mitigation efforts to reduce exposure are discussed. Furthermore the association of intake levels with biomarkers of exposure and internal dose, considering aspects of bioavailability, is reviewed, and a physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model is described that provides a good description of the kinetics of acrylamide in the rat. Each of the sections concludes with a summary of remaining gaps and uncertainties.",p
State-of-the-art ion chromatographic determination of inorganic ions in food.,"A review of the applications of ion chromatography (IC) to the determination of inorganic ions in food is presented. The most promising sample preparation techniques, such as accelerated solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, solid-phase extraction, UV photolysis, microwave-oven digestion and pyrohydrolysis are discussed. Among the various inorganic anions, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus species and halides are widely determined in foods and to a lesser extent only, cyanide, carbonate, arsenic and selenium species are considered. IC determination of inorganic cations deals with ammonium ion, alkali, alkaline-earth, heavy and transition metals particularly and only a small amount of literature is found on the other ones, like aluminium and plantinum. A particular advantage of IC over traditional techniques is the simultaneous determination of several species.",p
Intestinal transport of some macromolecules in food.,"This review focuses on the intestinal transport of macromolecules in food. Although it is known that neonates have the ability to absorb proteins from the intestine as a means of passive immunization, it has generally been assumed that adults do not retain this capability. A number of studies have shown that the adult mammalian small intestine is capable of transporting a variety of macromolecules in food to a very limited extent. The evidence demonstrating the transport of test substances in the micron-size range across the adult intestinal epithelial barrier is examined for a number of food substances and environmental contaminants. It will be shown that macromolecules can be transported across this barrier by endocytosis; by uptake into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and possibly by uptake into the goblet cells. It is considered highly unlikely that large micron-sized particles pass between intestinal cells due to the integrity of the tight junctions between cells that exclude particles in this size range. Quantitative estimates for macromolecular uptake are included along with a discussion of the physiological parameters influencing macromolecular transport.",p
Weaning foods: a review of the Indian experience.,"Although breastmilk is adequate to meet the energy and nutrient requirements of an infant up to four to six months of age, thereafter it is insufficient to sustain normal growth and needs to be supplemented with other foods, such as weaning foods. However, the capacity of a weaning diet to meet the protein and energy requirements of infants depends on its nutritional quality as well as its dietary bulk. This review highlights varieties of weaning foods, blend formulations, nutrient requirements, process characteristics, physicochemical parameters, quality evaluation, and other important aspects of developing a weaning food that satisfies all the requirements of the infant during the vulnerable transitional stage. Traditional weaning foods of India are briefly summarized.",p
Current status of the EPR method to detect irradiated food.,"This review gives a brief outline of the principles of the EPR detection method for irradiated foods by food type. For each food type, the scope, limitations and status of the method are given. The extensive reference list aims to include all which define the method, as well as some rarely cited works of historical importance.",p
Bacillus anthracis: current knowledge in relation to contamination of food.,"In this article, information related to anthrax and its etiologic agent, Bacillus anthracis, in food is reviewed. The major topics discussed include the taxonomic relationship of B. anthracis to other Bacillus species, methods used for the recovery of the organism from surfaces and foods, routes of infection, the pathogenesis of the organism, the microbial ecology of the vegetative cell and spore in foods and the environment, chemical and physical treatments for spore inactivation, and the control of the disease in animals.",p
Exopeptidases and their application to reduce bitterness in food: a review.,"When exopeptidases catalyze hydrolysis of peptide bonds, the product(s) may have a less bitter taste, and the free amino acids or small peptides formed may function in food as pleasant-tasting flavor compounds or as flavor precursors. There are several classes of exopeptidase based on specificity for hydrolysis of synthetic substrates. Exopeptidases in food-stuff may be of natural origin or may be extrinsic, that is, produced by microorganisms or parasites. Exopeptidases used to modify foods are also becoming increasingly available in the industrial enzyme market. Exopeptidases contribute to a variety of quality changes in postharvest fruit, meats, and food fermentations. Foodstuff impacted by these enzymes during processing include cocoa, beer, aged and cured meat products, koji, fish sauce, ripened cheeses, and protein hydrolysates. An important role of exopeptidases in food is the hydrolysis of hydrophobic, bitter peptides. The relationship between peptide structure and sensory transduction/receptor models is discussed. Research on the use of exopeptidases to reduce bitterness is reviewed.",p
"A review of the genotoxicity of food, drug and cosmetic colours and other azo, triphenylmethane and xanthene dyes.","The genetic toxicology of the major dyestuffs used in foods, drugs and cosmetics has been reviewed. Published data for azo, triphenylmethane and xanthene dyes from short-term assays for muta-carcinogenicity have been summarized and discussed according to usage, current and previous worldwide legislative status. Certain other synthetic food dyes, commercial mixtures, natural and polymeric colourants as well as a section on aminoazobenzene and its derivatives have been included. Genotoxicity has been discussed with reference to structural chemistry, levels of exposure, absorption and metabolism and to epidemiological information. The extent of agreement between data from different tests and correlations with animal cancer assays have been considered. Synthetic dyes from the 3 major structural classes exhibit genotoxicity, whilst only 2 natural colours have proved active. Activity may be due to the presence of certain functional groups, notably nitro- and amino-substituents which are metabolized to ultimate electrophiles that may be stabilized by electronic interaction with aryl rings. Metabolic processes such as azo-reduction may be activating or detoxifying. the low but significant correlation between animal carcinogenicity and short-term test data may be increased with further screening, especially involving chromosome assays. It is suggested that a human cancer hazard may exist where significant quantities of finished benzidine dye samples are handled. Such risks from exposures to other colours and the possibility of human germ-line mutation induction by dyestuffs cannot be meaningfully assessed.",p
Potential for increased human foodborne exposure to PCDD/F when recycling sewage sludge on agricultural land.,"Sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment is used in agriculture as a nutrient source and to aid in moisture retention. To examine the potential impact of sludge-amended soil on exposures to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from plant and animal foods, we conducted a review of published empirical data from international sources. Levels of PCDD/F in municipal sewage sludge ranged from 0.0005 to 8300 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ)/g. Background levels in soil ranged from 0.003 to 186 pg TEQ/g. In sludge-amended soils, levels of PCDD/F ranged from 1.4 to 15 pg TEQ/g. Studies that measured levels before and after sludge treatment showed an increase in soil concentration after treatment. Relationships between PCDD/F levels in soil and resulting concentrations in plants were very weakly positive for unpeeled root crops, leafy vegetables, tree fruits, hay, and herbs. Somewhat stronger relationships were observed for plants of the cucumber family. In all cases, large increases in soil concentration were required to achieve a measurable increase in plant contamination. A considerably stronger positive relationship was observed between PCDD/F in feed and resulting levels in cattle tissue, suggesting bioaccumulation. Although PCDD/Fs are excreted in milk, no association was found between feed contamination and levels of PCDD/Fs measured in milk. There is a paucity of realistic data describing the potential for entry of PCDD/Fs into the food supply via sewage sludge. Currently available data suggest that sewage sludge application to land used for most crops would not increase human exposure. However, the use of sludge on land used to graze animals appears likely to result in increased human exposure to PCDD/F.",p
Prey processing in amniotes: biomechanical and behavioral patterns of food reduction.,"In this paper we examine the biomechanics of prey processing behavior in the amniotes. Whether amniotes swallow prey items whole or swallow highly processed slurries or boluses of food, they share a common biomechanical system where hard surfaces (teeth or beaks) are brought together on articulated jaws by the actions of adductor muscles to grasp and process food. How have amniotes modified this basic system to increase the chewing efficiency of the system? To address this question we first examine the primitive condition for prey processing representative of many of the past and present predatory amniotes. Because herbivory is expected to be related to improved prey processing in the jaws we review patterns of food processing mechanics in past and present herbivores. Herbivory has appeared numerous times in amniotes and several solutions to the task of chewing plant matter have appeared. Birds have abandoned jaw chewing in favor of a new way to chew--with the gut--so we will detour from the jaws to examine the appearance of gut chewing in the archosaurs. We will then fill in the gaps among amniote taxa with a look at some new data on patterns of prey processing behavior and jaw mechanics in lizards. Finally, we examine evolutionary patterns of amniote feeding mechanism and how correlates of chewing relate to the need to increase the efficiency of prey processing in order to facilitate increased metabolic rate and activity.",p
Development of gastrointestinal and pancreatic functions in mammalians (mainly bovine and porcine species): influence of age and ingested food.,"This review summarizes recent advances in knowledge on the development of digestive tissues and their productions as well as mechanisms of regulation in response to age and ingested food in mammalian species (mainly bovine and porcine species). In the first two sections, changes are reported for stomach, pancreas and small intestine, and examined in relation to different situations (colostral, milk feeding and weaned periods). The implication of some regulatory substances (growth factors, gut regulatory peptides and neurohormonal substances) in regulation mechanisms is discussed over these periods. For example, the plasma pattern of several gut regulatory peptides and the expression of their specific receptors could explain certain phenomena of digestive development. Recent cellular and molecular aspects of regulation of the digestive enzyme production are also reported. Finally, an approach to interactions existing between age and ingested food is given in the last section. In conclusion, although some phenomena are well established, it is often difficult to distinguish what the age- and food-dependent events are in the development of the digestive function.",p
The relationship of allergen-specific IgE levels and oral food challenge outcome.,"BACKGROUND
Oral food challenges remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of food allergy. However, clear clinical and laboratory guidelines have not been firmly established to determine when oral challenges should be performed.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to determine the value of food-specific IgE levels in predicting challenge outcome.


METHODS
A retrospective chart review of 604 food challenges in 391 children was performed. All children had food-specific IgE levels measured by means of CAP-RAST before challenge. Data were analyzed to determine the relationship between food-specific IgE levels and challenge outcome, as well as the relationship between other clinical parameters and challenge outcome.


RESULTS
Forty-five percent of milk challenges were passed compared with 57% for egg, 59% for peanut, 67% for wheat, and 72% for soy. Specific IgE levels were higher among patients who failed challenges than among those who passed (P </=.03 for each food). When seeking a specific IgE level at which a 50% pass rate could be expected, a cutoff level of 2 kUA/L was determined for milk, egg, and peanut. Data were less clear for wheat and soy. Coexistent eczema or asthma was associated with failed egg challenges, but other atopic disease was otherwise not associated with challenge outcome.


CONCLUSIONS
Allergen-specific IgE concentrations to milk, egg, and peanut and, to a lesser extent, wheat and soy serve as useful predictors of challenge outcome and should be considered when selecting patients for oral challenge to these foods.",p
Drug interactions with irbesartan.,"Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Although irbesartan does not require biotransformation for its pharmacological activity, it does undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isoenzyme and negligible metabolism by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The long term treatment of patients with hypertension is generally required for effective management of the disease, and the use of concurrent medications is usually inevitable. This paper reviews the drug and food interaction trials involving irbesartan that have been conducted to date. Based on the available literature, no significant interactions have been identified between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, simvastatin, tolbutamide, warfarin, magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, digoxin or food. Fluconazole did increase the steady-state peak plasma concentration (by 19%) and area under the concentration-time curve (by 63%) of irbesartan, but these increases are not likely to be clinically significant. In summary, irbesartan has demonstrated minimal potential for drug or food interactions in trials conducted to date.",p
Sentiment Classification of Food Reviews,"  Sentiment analysis of reviews is a popular task in natural language
processing. In this work, the goal is to predict the score of food reviews on a
scale of 1 to 5 with two recurrent neural networks that are carefully tuned. As
for baseline, we train a simple RNN for classification. Then we extend the
baseline to GRU. In addition, we present two different methods to deal with
highly skewed data, which is a common problem for reviews. Models are evaluated
using accuracies.

Effects of food on clinical pharmacokinetics.,"Food-drug interactions can be associated with alterations in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of various drugs that may have clinical implications. The various phases in which food may interact with a coadministered drug are: (i) before and during gastrointestinal absorption; (ii) during distribution; (iii) during metabolism; and (iv) during elimination. Absorption and metabolism are the phases where food has most effect, and this review will focus on those areas. It will also review the variable and complex effects of antacids and metal ions on drug absorption. Mechanisms related to food effects on drug absorption have been described under 5 categories: those causing decreased, delayed, increased or accelerated absorption, and those in which food has no significant effect. Among the major variables that interface between differential effects of food and postprandial bioavailability are: (i) the physicochemical characteristics and enantiomorphic composition of the drug; (ii) timing of meals in relation to time of drug administration; (iii) size and composition of meals (especially fat, protein and fibre); and (iv) dose size. However, the influence of food is largely a matter of the design of the pharmaceutical formulation. In addition, the mechanism of 'food effect' may involve physiological and sensory responses to food, such as changes in gastrointestinal milieu and gastric emptying rate, reflex action, and may also involve the site and route (either portal or lymphatic) of drug absorption. Mixing drugs with fruit juice, such as grapefruit and orange juice, and acidic beverages, such as commercial soft drinks, may affect absorption because of decreases in gastric pH, which could offer a therapeutic advantage in certain clinical conditions, such as patients with HIV disease and cancer. The increased bioavailability caused by the concomitant intake of grapefruit juice results from the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450(CYP)3A4, but not hepatic CYP3A4 or colon CYP3A5, which probably involves the bioflavonoid naringenin and furanocoumarins. Although there is a vast amount of literature, there is still no rational scientific basis to predict the effect of food for a particular chemical entity or a chemical class of therapeutic agents. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of food may serve as a key to the pharmacokinetic optimisation of patient therapy, both in outpatients and hospitalised patients of various age groups.",p
Technological aspects of use of sulfiting agents in food.,A review of the current literature indicates that scientific knowledge of sulfiting agents in food is changing rapidly. Many of the old assumptions about usage of sulfiting agents have been put in doubt by new scientific data. Some basic definitions of sulfiting agents and their chemical behavior in food are presented.,p
Clinical spectrum of food allergy in children in Australia and South-East Asia: identification and targets for treatment.,"The prevalence of atopic diseases is increasing worldwide for reasons that are not clear. Food allergies are the earliest manifestations of atopy. This review defines the foods most commonly involved in allergic reactions and identifies an emerging group of syndromes in which food allergy is involved. A study of the frequency of food allergies in Australia and South-East Asia has recently shown that egg, cow's milk and peanut are the most common food allergens in Australia, but there were divergent results from different regions of South-East Asia. It is not clear whether the differences in reactivity to foods are due to genetic or cultural factors, but the findings raise the possibility that genetic susceptibility to food allergy may operate at the T-cell level modulated by the major histocompatibility complex. The Melbourne Milk Allergy Study defined a wide range of clinical symptoms and syndromes that could be reproduced by dietary challenge. A subsequent analysis of the infants with hypersensitivity to cow's milk and other multiple food proteins identified a new syndrome, multiple food protein intolerance of infancy. Food challenges demonstrated reactions developing slowly days after commencement of low-allergen soy formula or extensively hydrolysed formula. Follow-up at the age of 3 years showed that most children with this disorder tolerated most foods apart from cow's milk, egg and peanut. Atopic dermatitis affects about 18% of infants in the first 2 years of life. In a community-based study we have shown a very strong association (RR 3.5) between atopic dermatitis and infants with immunoglobulin E allergy to cow's milk, egg or peanut. Family studies on these infants have shown a link between atopic dermatitis and the genomic region 5q31 adjacent to the interleukin-4 gene cluster. Infantile colic (distress) affects 15-40% of infants in the first 4 months of life. Many theories of causation have been proposed, but a study from our centre showed that dietary modification, particularly that of breastfeeding mothers whose infants present with colic before the age of 6 weeks, alleviated symptoms. Colic associated with vomiting has been attributed to gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). This has been considered primarily a motility disorder, but a secondary form resulting from food protein intolerance has been described recently. We have also recently identified a group of infants with distressed behaviour attributed to GOR who have failed to respond to H2-receptor antagonists, prokinetic agents and multiple formula changes. Symptoms resolved on commencement of an elemental amino acid-based formula. In two-thirds of the patients, symptoms relapsed when challenged with low-allergen soy formula or extensively hydrolysed formula. We propose that a period of food protein intolerance is a part of the normal development of the immune system as it encounters common dietary proteins in infancy and early childhood. Future targets for research are development of appropriate dietary and management strategies for these entities and identification of genetic markers for these disorders.",p
"Rituximab for reduction of anti-HLA antibodies in patients awaiting renal transplantation: 1. Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics.","BACKGROUND
Preformed HLA antibodies (Ab), reported as panel-reactive antibody (PRA), prolong patient waiting time for kidney transplantation. We hypothesized that rituximab (RTX) could reduce PRA via B-cell depletion. This initial study reports the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RTX in patients with end-stage renal failure.


METHODS
The study was an investigator-initiated single-dose, dose-escalation phase I trial of RTX in chronic dialysis patients (PRA >50%). It was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Food and Drug Administration. Nine subjects were treated with a single dose of RTX (n=3 per group) at 50, 150, or 375 mg/m. Peripheral lymphocyte cell surface markers and HLA Ab levels (%PRA and titers) were tested using flow cytometry.


RESULTS
There were four significant adverse events: a suspected histoplasmosis infection; two Tenchkoff dialysis catheter infections; and fever (38.7 degrees C) during infusion. At 2 days after RTX therapy, there was depletion of CD19 cells (pre-RTX 181+/-137 vs. post-RTX 12+/-5.6, P =0.006). In 2 (22%) of 9 subjects, there was no appreciable change in PRA. Among the other seven patients, one had a decrease in PRA from 87% to 51% with a concurrent decrease in fluorescence intensity; five patients had changes in histogram architecture suggesting loss of antibody specificity; and one patient had a fourfold decrease in PRA titer from 1:64 to 1:16 at 6 months after treatment. In addition, one of the seven patients converted a donor-specific crossmatch to negative and underwent a successful living donor kidney transplantation.


CONCLUSIONS
RTX can be safely administered and may be an effective agent to reduce high-titer anti-HLA Abs in subjects awaiting kidney transplantation.",p
Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry for the determination of elements and elemental species in food: a review.,"Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has definitely emerged as a powerful technique for total element determination and as a sensitive and selective detector in hyphenated methods for speciation analyses of elements in foods.

"Fumigants and related chemicals in foods: review of residue findings, contamination sources, and analytical methods.","Public concern over chemical residues in foods increased in the United States during the early 1980s. Potentially hazardous levels of ethylene dibromide (EDB), a relatively non-volatile fumigant, were detected in several finished grain-based products by governmental food-monitoring laboratories. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the use of EDB as a fumigant in 1983. Commercial fumigators then began using more of the highly volatile chemicals such as methyl bromide and phosphine. These chemicals are less likely to leave residues on stored crops than the previously used fumigants such as EDB, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. However, trace residues of many pest-control fumigants and related industrial chemicals are currently found in assorted foods. This contamination may come from the original fumigation of stored crops, or from the industrial chemicals occurring in the environment and in food processing chains. No potential health problem is indicated at this time. Yet scientists continue to uncover the sources of this chemical contamination, and to develop better methods to monitor foods for it. They also seek better ways to protect foodstuffs from pests prior to human consumption.",p
Potential food contaminants and associated health risks.,"The potential toxicants in food are derived from natural or industrial sources. Compounds like lectins and glycoalkaloids that are toxic to man are naturally present in some vegetables like potatoes or legumes. A wide variety of marine toxins mostly produced by dinoflagellates occurring secondarily in molluscs and mussels are usually ingested by human beings causing poisoning. On the other hand, toxic compounds find their way into food during manufacture, storage, or transportation. These include largely the industrial contaminants, persistent organic pollutants (POP), pesticides, heavy metals, and toxins of fungal and bacterial origin. Further, toxic compounds like higher alcohols may be produced as byproducts during processing. Migration of compounds from packaging materials into packaged food like contamination with lead from solder in certain metal cans is well known. Additives (emulsifiers, preservatives, and antioxidants) could also influence the quality of foods. Solvent residues may find their way into food as a result of their use in extraction processes like the use of trichloroethylene and methylene chloride in decaffeination of coffee. In addition, poor hygiene, storage, and preparation may also lead to food contamination by various microbes and ova or cysts of nematodes. The problem of food contamination can be overcome to a great extent by regular surveillance and monitoring programmes and strict implementation of food and adulteration act. In the present review some of these aspects of food contamination have been discussed in detail.",p
Recent advances in methodology for analysis of phytate and inositol phosphates in foods.,"This review summarises the methods available for the analysis of phytate and structurally related molecules, i.e., inositol polyphosphates. Phytate has been determined by colorimetry, low pressure ion exchange column chromatography, phosphorus-31 fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P FT NMR), near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Among these techniques anion exchange column chromatography and HPLC were shown to be best suited for separation of inositol phosphates. Since inositol phosphates do not have a characteristic absorption spectrum, their detection in HPLC analysis is limited to methods employing monitoring of refractive index, post column reaction products, conductivity or indirect detection although other detection methods may be feasible. As refractive index detection under isocratic eluent conditions is relatively easy to manipulate, anion-exchange HPLC methods using a low capacity column or ion-pair HPLC methods are recommended for the analysis of inositol phosphates in nutritional studies.",p
The impact of the quality of silage on animal health and food safety: a review.,"This paper reviews the microbiological aspects of forage preserved by ensilage. The main principles of preservation by ensilage are a rapid achievement of a low pH by lactic acid fermentation and the maintenance of anaerobic conditions. The silage microflora consists of beneficial micro-organisms, i.e. the lactic acid bacteria responsible for the silage fermentation process, and a number of harmful micro-organisms that are involved in anaerobic or aerobic spoilage processes. Micro-organisms that can cause anaerobic spoilage are enterobacteria and clostridia. Clostridium tyrobutyricum is of particular importance because of its ability to use lactic acid as a substrate. Silage-derived spores of C. tyrobutyricum can cause problems in cheese making. Aerobic spoilage of silage is associated with penetration of oxygen into the silage during storage or feeding. Lactate-oxidizing yeasts are generally responsible for the initiation of aerobic spoilage. The secondary aerobic spoilage flora consists of moulds, bacilli, listeria, and enterobacteria. Mycotoxin-producing moulds, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes in aerobically deteriorated silage form a serious risk to the quality and safety of milk and to animal health.",p
Child development: vulnerability and resilience.,"Many of the challenges facing children now are a function of changing times, including increase in urbanization, political violence, changing family forms, and in some areas decreased supplies of adequate food. This review focuses particularly on those changes in which children are the victims and which induce new threats for them, rather than on problems such as child disability or mental illness. The outcome variables of interest in this paper are dimensions of children's psychosocial development, including cognitive development, psychological adjustment and aggression, whereas the companion paper in this issue (Caldwell P., Child survival: vulnerability and resilience in adversity in the European past and the contemporary Third World, Soc. Sci. Med.) [1] focuses on physical aspects of children's development. The risks that are hurdles in the process of development of a young child begin from conception and carry on into later life. To address them all would be impossible; thus, in order to do justice to the issues at hand, we have chosen those risks that, in our view, are important in a child's psychosocial development in developing countries. This paper will thus provide a discussion of the concepts of risk and resilience, then apply these concepts to the analysis of three examples of risk faced by children today: nutritional threats (e.g. malnutrition due to decline in breastfeeding); family dynamics and types of family forms (e.g. child fostering and non-traditional families); and experiences of violence (domestic or political). In each case, the same four questions will be addressed: what are the consequences of the risk factor for children, what are the etiologies and conditions of risk, are there any children who seem to cope with the risk factor successfully and what are some of the protective factors, and what interventions or programs would help support these children?",p
"Histidine, histamine, and the neuroregulation of food intake: a review and hypothesis.","Feeding, a behavior regulated by the central nervous system (CNS), includes the acquisition of specific essential nutrients and the maintenance of energy balance. Modulation of feeding behavior is a normal part of survival, but certain pathological conditions interrupt or modify regulatory aspects of feeding, thereby leading to inappropriate intake. This review examines aspects of metabolism associated with the anorexia seen in animals suffering from protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). The main focus is the indispensable amino acid histidine (His), the biosynthetic precursor of the neurotransmitter histamine (HA). In kwashiorkor-like PEM, His is elevated in plasma and brain, whereas all other indispensable amino acids are decreased. The elevation of His in the brain is to concentrations five times normal. Because the rate of HA synthesis in the brain is a function of the His concentration, His elevation raises the possibility of a profound direct effect of CNS function. In children, PEM consistently produces the symptoms of depressed food intake, edema, growth failure, and psychomotor changes. One known central effect of HA is the stimulation of ACTH and corticosteroid release. Based on these observations, the hypothesis being examined is as follows: one component of the pathophysiological neuroregulation of food intake involved the His-induced variation of HA concentration in the hypothalamus and the subsequently altered neurochemical activity at the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons o the paraventricular nucleus (PVN).",p
Chromatographic and related techniques for the determination of aromatic heterocyclic amines in foods.,"Some 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered a new group of highly toxic compounds, classified as heterocyclic aromatic amines, from broiled and grilled meat and fish products. Numerous studies have shown that most HAs are mutagenic and carcinogenic, and the safety of HA-containing foods has become a concern for the public. To date, more than 20 different mutagenic and/or carcinogenic heterocyclic amines have been identified in foods. This paper reviews the analysis of foods for HAs with 145 references. We survey some of the numerous methods available for the chromatographic analysis of heterocyclic amines and highlight the recent advances. We discuss chromatographic and related techniques, including capillary electrophoresis, and their coupling to mass spectrometry for the determination of these contaminants in foods. In addition, the review summarises data on the content of HAs in various cooked foods.",p
Evaluation and use of pet foods: general considerations in using pet foods for adult maintenance.,"Questions regarding pet animal nutrition are probably among the most frequent queries encountered by companion animal veterinarians.

"Dietary Reference Intakes: the new basis for recommendations for calcium and related nutrients, B vitamins, and choline.","Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) represent the new approach adopted by the Food and Nutrition Board to providing quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes for use in a variety of settings, replacing and expanding on the past 50 years of periodic updates and revisions of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). The DRI activity is a comprehensive effort undertaken to include current concepts about the role of nutrients and food components in long-term health, going beyond deficiency diseases. The DRIs consist of 4 reference intakes: the RDA, which is to be used as a goal for the individual; the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), which is given to assist in advising individuals what levels of intake may result in adverse effects if habitually exceeded; the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), the intake level at which the data indicate that the needs for 50% of those consuming it will not be met; and the Adequate Intake (AI), a level judged by the experts developing the reference intakes to meet the needs of all individuals in a group, but which is based on much less data and substantially more judgment than that used in establishing an EAR and subsequently the RDA. When an RDA cannot be set, an AI is given. Both are to be used as goals for an individual. Two reports have been issued providing DRIs for nutrients and food components reviewed to date: these include calcium and its related nutrients: phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, and fluoride; and most recently, folate, the B vitamins, and choline. The approaches used to determine the DRIs, the reference values themselves, and the plans for future nutrients and food components are discussed.",p
Methods for gas chromatography-olfactometry: a review.,"Gas chromatography-olfactometry methods are used in flavor research to determine the odor active compounds in foods. In this review, the four major methods for gas chromatography-olfactometry are described and their potentials and limitations discussed. The methods include dilution analysis, detection frequency methods, posterior intensity methods and time-intensity methods. The value of gas chromatography olfactometry data is shown to depend directly on the gas chromatography-olfactometry method, as well as on sample preparation and analytical conditions. Each of the methods has been used frequently and has its advantages and disadvantages. However, on the methodological side, a considerable area is still to be explored, which would contribute to the interpretation of the data and would improve the value of these techniques for both fundamental and applied research.",p
Changes in childhood food consumption patterns: a cause for concern in light of increasing body weights.,"Childhood obesity is currently at its highest: recent statistics show that 16% of children between the ages of 6 and 11 y are overweight [> or =95th percentile of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) for age] and that an additional 14.3% are at risk of becoming overweight (> or =85th percentile but < 95th percentile of BMI for age). As children's body weights have increased, so has their consumption of fast foods and soft drinks. The proportion of foods that children consumed from restaurants and fast food outlets increased by nearly 300% between 1977 and 1996. Children's soft drink consumption has also increased during those years, and now soft drinks provide soft drink consumers 188 kcal/d beyond the energy intake of nonconsumers. These changes in food intakes among children may partly explain the rise in childhood obesity observed in the past few years. Although the mechanism of appetite regulation will not be explored in this report, it is hypothesized that the greater energy intakes in children who consume large amounts of soft drinks and fast foods are not compensated for by increased physical activity or decreased energy intakes. Furthermore, overweight and obesity in childhood may predispose persons to morbidity in adulthood. Blood pressure and fasting insulin and cholesterol concentrations are higher in overweight children than in normal-weight children. This review focuses on current food patterns and eating habits of children, in an attempt to explain their increasing BMI. In addition, a critical review of food service and political practices regarding food choices for children at school is included.",p
Does nutritionist review of a self-administered food frequency questionnaire improve data quality?,"OBJECTIVE
This study sought to evaluate the benefit of utilizing a nutritionist review of a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), to determine whether accuracy could be improved beyond that produced by the self-administered questionnaire alone.


DESIGN
Participants randomized into a dietary intervention trial completed both a FFQ and a 4-day food record (FR) at baseline before entry into the intervention. The FFQ was self-administered, photocopied and then reviewed by a nutritionist who used additional probes to help complete the questionnaire. Both the versions before nutritionist review and after nutritionist review - were individually compared on specific nutrients to the FR by means, correlations and per cent agreement into quintiles.


SETTINGS AND SUBJECTS
Three hundred and twenty-four people, a subset of participants from the Polyp Prevention Trial - a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of a low-fat, high-fibre, high fruit and vegetable dietary pattern on the recurrence of adenomatous polyps - were recruited from clinical centres at the University of Utah, University of Buffalo, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Kaiser Permanente Medical Program in Oakland.


RESULTS
Reviewing the FFQ increased correlations with the FR for every nutrient, and per cent agreement into quintiles for all nutrients except calcium. Energy was underestimated in both versions of the FFQ but to a lesser degree in the version with review.


CONCLUSIONS
One must further evaluate whether the increases seen with nutritionist review of the FFQ will enhance our ability to predict diet-disease relationships and whether it is cost-effective when participant burden and money spent utilizing trained personnel are considered.",p

"Proposed association between ileoanal j-pouch perforation and rapid consumption of a high-calorie, high-fiber meal: report of two cases.","PURPOSE
We report two cases of ileoanal J-pouch rupture after rapid consumption of high-fiber, high-calorie meals.


METHOD
We review the food intake, presentation, laboratory and radiographic data, and course of two patients who developed ileoanal J-pouch perforation after rapid consumption of meals rich in fiber or calories or both. The potential association between food consumption and rupture is explored.


RESULTS
The authors propose that the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may lead to an acute intraluminal pressure elevation or a closed-loop obstruction. These effects may be the basis for an association between food ingestion patterns and perforation at the distal transection site in an ileoanal J-pouch.


CONCLUSION
The authors hypothesize that the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may be associated with J-pouch perforation. Further investigative efforts are needed to confirm this association and to evaluate whether a causal relationship is present. If causality is established, physicians may develop a higher index of suspicion for pouch rupture in patients who present with abdominal disturbances after the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal.",p
International legislation on trace elements as contaminants in food: a review.,"Environmental contaminants such as trace elements may be present in all foods. Foods, raw materials and ingredients for food production are to an increasing extent traded across borders. Hence, there is a need for international legislation on trace elements as contaminants in food. In 1961, the FAO and WHO established the Codex Alimentarius to elaborate international food legislation. Contaminants in food are handled by the Codex Committee for Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC). The Codex Alimentarius system for developing legislation concerning trace elements as contaminants in food is based upon the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food (GSCTF). By October 2001, the principles for setting maximum limits (MLs) for contaminants in food are agreed, and work is in progress on MLs for trace elements such as lead and cadmium in the various food categories. The status for the proposals is presented and discussed. The EU Regulation 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 sets MLs for lead and cadmium in various foods. This regulation will apply from 5 April 2002. The EU regulation is more detailed but similar to the Codex draft standards for lead and cadmium in food. In future, legislators and administrators in the Codex and EU and analytical chemists will discuss how to use more and better analytical data as risk-management tools to protect public health. Trace elements' speciation is an important aspect of this discussion.",p
Review of the 1995 Food and Drug Administration/National Institutes of Health Public Forum on informed consent in clinical research conducted in emergency circumstances.,"We describe some of the deliberations and questions raised by the recent Food and Drug Administration/National Institutes of Health Forum on Informed Consent in Clinical Research Conducted in Emergency Circumstances. Consent will have to be waived in emergency medical research if such research is to be conducted, because it is virtually impossible to obtain meaningful informed consent in emergency circumstances. There is clearly a conflict between research subject autonomy and society's perceived need for answers about emergency medical care. Who will resolve this dilemma and how it will be resolved are important questions for modern medicine.",p
Diagnosis and management of food allergy and intolerance in dogs and cats.,"This paper reviews food allergy and intolerance in dogs and cats. Adverse reactions to ingested food components can affect many systems and can produce signs involving the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract and central nervous system, and these clinical signs are reviewed. Most basic food ingredients have the potential to induce an allergic response, although most reactions are caused by proteins. In particular, dogs and cats can become sensitive to cow's milk, beef, fish or cereal. Food allergy and intolerance is rare in dogs and cats, although the incidence in practice is difficult to establish. Clinical signs are quite variable, depending on the individual response, although the major clinical sign is pruritus. Diagnosis can be difficult, as there is no single test available to help the clinician to confirm or refute the presence of food sensitivity. Diagnosis is based on dietary investigation in the form of elimination diets and test meals. Elimination diets for dogs include lamb, chicken, rabbit, horse meat and fish as sources of protein, with rice or potatoes. Successful elimination diets for cats include lamb, chicken, rabbit or venison, with rice. Improvement in clinical signs while on the elimination diet is suggestive of food allergy. The diagnosis should be confirmed by feeding the original diet, with the development of clinical signs within 7 to 14 days of feeding.",p
"Preferences, quantities and concerns: socio-cultural perspectives on the gendered consumption of foods.","A review of the sociological research regarding the gendered features of food consumption is presented. The focus is upon differences between women and men in regard to their preferences for particular foods and types of meals, seen in relation to the cultural function of foods as symbolic markers of femininity or masculinity, assessments of the quantities of food consumed by women and men respectively, and differences between women and men in regard to concerns with food safety, health, weight reduction and fitness. Some methodological limitations of this research are discussed with particular reference to the need for interdisciplinary cooperation between sociologists and nutritionists in the design and analysis of dietary surveys. Suggestions are made in regard to future directions for sociological research in this field, with particular reference to the issue that dietary recommendations appear to focus upon increasing the consumption of foods that are markers of femininity and decreasing the consumption of foods that are markers of masculinity in Western food culture.",p
"Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, and Comutagenic Aromatic Amines in Human Foods.","Three recent topics related to possible exposure of humans to mutagenic and carcinogenic aromatic amines and related compounds in foods are reviewed. A food additive, AF-2,2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide, was first demonstrated to be mutagenic in Escherichia coli WP-2 and then proved to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. This is an example of prediction of the carcinogenicity of a compound from results of short-term microbial tests. Pyrolysates of amino acids, proteins, and foods high in a protein contain many heterocyclic aromatic amine compounds. For example, a tryptophan pyrolysate contains two derivatives ofamino-gamma-carboline(pyridoindole), and a glutamicd acid pyrolysate contains two derivatives of djipyridoimidazole. These compounds are strong frameshift mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium. Some of them were carcinogenic in an in vitro transformation test and were also carcinogenic when injected sc into hamsters and rats and when given orally to mice. Carcinogenic aromatic amines, such as aniline, and o-toluidine and yellow OB were demonstrated to be mutagenic in the presence of the beta-carboline, norharman, with S-9 mix. Diphenylnitrosamine was also mutagenic in the presence of norharman, which is present in tobacco tar and broiled food. These mutagenicities of aniline, o-toluidine, yellow OB, and diphenylnitrosamine are discussed in relation to an evaluation of compounds as environmental carcinogens from the results of short-term microbial tests.",p

A review of Fife's food and health policy.,"Fife Health Board published its food and health policy in May 1986, introduced a board-wide food and health strategy in 1987, and carried out a comprehensive review of its implementation in 1990. Other health boards currently considering their strategies may benefit by learning from Fife's experience. A number of base-line studies were carried out between 1987 and 1989 before the policy was implemented. Further surveys have monitored progress. Positive features of the programme included the introduction of a comprehensive food and health policy throughout the health board, the establishment of base-line measurements for future outcome evaluation, and the enthusiastic support of a wide range of people. Negative features included some opposition from a number of health service staff to its introduction, lukewarm support from public leaders for its proposed public launch, and a patchy response from the education sector. Although it is still too early to be confident of the success of policy in terms of outcome measures, there is some evidence that the first phase of its introduction may have had some success within the health service. Alternative strategies are now required to tackle some of the areas where the introduction was less successful.",p
Significance of microbial biofilms in food industry: a review.,"Biofilms have been of considerable interest in the context of food hygiene. Of special significance is the ability of microorganisms to attach and grow on food and food-contact surfaces under favourable conditions. Biofilm formation is a dynamic process and different mechanisms are involved in their attachment and growth. Extracellular polymeric substances play an important role in the attachment and colonization of microorganisms to food-contact surfaces. Various techniques have been adopted for the proper study and understanding of biofilm attachment and control. If the microorganisms from food-contact surfaces are not completely removed, they may lead to biofilm formation and also increase the biotransfer potential. Therefore, various preventive and control strategies like hygienic plant lay-out and design of equipment, choice of materials, correct use and selection of detergents and disinfectants coupled with physical methods can be suitably applied for controlling biofilm formation on food-contact surfaces. In addition, bacteriocins and enzymes are gaining importance and have an unique potential in the food industry for the effective biocontrol and removal of biofilms. These newer biocontrol strategies are considered important for the maintenance of biofilm-free systems, for quality and safety of foods.",p
Platelet function in cardiopulmonary bypass and artificial organs.,"Extensive contact between blood and synthetic surfaces is associated with both quantitative and qualitative changes in platelet function. Cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a decline in the circulating platelet count, release of platelet alpha granules and possibly platelet dense and lysosomal granule release, and a prolongation of the bleeding time. It is assumed that these platelet alterations contribute to postoperative blood loss and reoperation for bleeding. Improvements in technology have reduced but not eliminated the adverse platelet changes. Temporary inhibition of platelet function during surface contact has achieved additional improvement in the setting of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but is not yet suitable for ""routine"" open heart surgery. Long-term cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation is receiving increased use during acute respiratory insufficiency. Systemic anticoagulation is required. Bleeding and platelet consumption continue as clinical problems and are treated by repeated platelet transfusion. Because no air interface is present in this setting and the synthetic surface is homogeneous this would appear to be the ideal area for application of platelet functional inhibition and synthetic surface passivation to reduce platelet consumption. Although still under review by the Food and Drug Administration, pulsatile devices, including the total artificial heart, increasingly are being used to provide temporary support for the failing heart. Furthermore, it is likely that totally implantable devices will become available in the very near future. Considering that thromboembolism is a major problem for recipients of mechanical valves, it is likely that thromboembolism will persist as a limiting factor in the further implementation of pulsatile devices. It is assumed that imaginative antithrombotic therapy will be required and that platelet activation will be fundamental to the thrombotic process. Platelet behavior in this setting, however, remains incompletely characterized. The analytical methodology that has been used to assess platelet behavior during cardiopulmonary bypass should be applied to the pulsatile devices as well and results correlated with clinical problems. This should permit standardization of antithrombotic therapy and rational use of platelet functional inhibition.",p
PCR-DGGE fingerprinting: novel strategies for detection of microbes in food.,"Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting was recently introduced into food microbiology. This paper describes the technique and reports on the state-of-the-art application of this technique to food and food-related ecosystems. Applications of PCR-DGGE in several fields of food microbiology are reviewed: the identification of microorganisms isolated from food, the evaluation of microbial diversity during food fermentation, and microbiological and commercial food quality assessment. Potentials and limitations of this culture-independent approach in food microbiology are indicated and future perspectives are discussed.",p
Naltrexone in addicted business executives and physicians.,"Naltrexone, an orally administered, synthetic, long-acting narcotic antagonist, is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Specifically, the FDA is reviewing the preclinical (toxicology, reproduction and teratology, and carcinogenicity studies) and clinical (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III) data to determine if the drug is safe and effective. When the New Drug Application (NDA) is approved, naltrexone will be available as an unscheduled prescription medication, useful as an adjunct in the maintenance of an opioid dependence-free state in former narcotic abusers. FDA approval of naltrexone for marketing will conclude more than three and a half decades of research on narcotic antagonists by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and its predecessors.",p
Plant-based raw material: improved food quality for better nutrition via plant genomics.,"Plants form the basis of the human food chain.

Lipid oxidation on foods.,"This review discusses the basic chemical reactions that affect food flavor quality. Although there are many reactions that can lead to the deterioration of quality in foods, this review focuses on lipid oxidation and how it adversely affects flavor principals. It also presents technological advances for studying the basic mechanism of lipid oxidation, for measuring its intensity, and for retaining food quality. The food commodities that provide the subject matter for this review include vegetable oils, legumes, cereal grains, eggs, beef, lamb, poultry, seafoods, and catfish. The methodologies for assessing food quality form a multidisciplinary approach that includes primarily instrumental analysis by direct gas chromatography, chemical analysis by the TBA test, and sensory analysis by quantitative descriptive determinations. The author hopes that the information presented in this review is applicable to food commodities not discussed.",p

Diet and monoamine oxidase inhibitors: a re-examination.,"Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are attracting renewed attention as effective antidepressants for refractory depressions, particularly among the elderly. However, widespread fears concerning the interactions of MAOIs with tyramine-containing foods have led to the development of long and complicated diets. These diets have served as an obstacle to the ready use of MAOIs, yet very little systematic or critical review of the basis for food restriction has been undertaken. An international survey of MAOI diets was conducted and from the diets collected, foods were categorized according to frequency of restriction on the diet lists. On the basis of this survey and a critical review of the literature it was determined that only four foods clearly warrant absolute prohibition: aged cheese, pickled fish (herring), concentrated yeast extracts and broad bean pods. While there is insufficient evidence to prohibit alcohol completely (even chianti wine) true moderation must apply. It is suggested that a radically simplified diet should be investigated on a prospective basis.",p
Treatment of urticaria and angioedema: low-sedating H1-type antihistamines.,"H1-type antihistamines are considered the therapeutic agents of choice for treating urticaria and angioedema. The use of traditional H1 antihistamines is limited by their side effects. In recent years low-sedating H1 antihistamines with reduced sedative and anticholinergic side effects have become popular choices for the treatment of urticaria and angioedema. Terfenadine and astemizole are currently available in the United States, and cetirizine and loratadine, currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, are available in other countries. Terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine achieve rapid peak plasma concentrations in 1 to 2 hours, whereas astemizole has a slow onset of action. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of chronic idiopathic urticaria, low-sedating H1 antihistamines were more effective than placebo. The choice of a particular low-sedating H1 antihistamine depends on pharmacokinetic considerations and frequency of administration.",p
Chromatographic analysis of tetracycline antibiotics in foods.,"Tetracycline antibiotics (TCs), such as oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline, have for decades continued to play an important role in veterinary medicine and feed additives because of the broad spectrum antibiotics and their economical advantages. Many analysis methods of TCs, therefore, have been reported to monitor their residues in foods. We review the recent developments in chromatographic analysis methods for TCs in foods. This review involves the following techniques: thin layer chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and sample preparation including extraction and clean up procedures.",p

Enhancing the absorption of fortification iron. A SUSTAIN Task Force report.,"Iron deficiency remains a major global health problem affecting an estimated 2 billion people. The World Health Organization ranked it as the seventh most important preventable risk for disease, disability, and death in 2002. Since an important factor in its causation is the poor bioavailability of iron in the cereal-based diets of many developing countries, SUSTAIN set up a Task Force, consisting of nutritional, medical, industry, and government experts to consider strategies for enhancing the absorption of fortification iron. This paper summarizes the findings of this Task Force. Detailed reviews of each strategy follow this overview. Highly soluble compounds of iron like ferrous sulfate are desirable food fortificants but cannot be used in many food vehicles because of sensory issues. Thus, potentially less well-absorbed forms of iron commonly are used in food fortification. The bioavailability of iron fortificants can, however, be enhanced with innovative ingredient technologies. Ascorbic acid, NaFeEDTA, ferrous bisglycinate, and dephytinization all enhance the absorption of fortification iron, but add to the overall costs of fortification. While all strategies cannot be recommended for all food fortification vehicles, individual strategies can be recommended for specific foods. For example, the addition of ascorbic acid is appropriate for dry blended foods such as infant foods and other dry products made for reconstitution that are packaged, stored, and prepared in a way that maximizes retention of this vitamin. NaFeEDTA can be recommended for fortification of fish sauce and soy sauce, whereas amino acid chelates may be more useful in milk products and beverages. With further development, dephytinization may be possible for low-cost, cereal-based complementary foods in developing countries. Encapsulation of iron salts in lipid coatings, while not an iron absorption-enhancing strategy per se, can prevent soluble forms of iron from interacting undesirably with some food vehicles and hence broaden the application of some fortificants. Research relevant to each of these strategies for enhancing the bioavailability or utility of iron food fortificants is reviewed. Individual strategies are evaluated in terms of enhancing effect and stability, organoleptic qualities, cost, and regulatory issues of interest to the nutrition community, industry, and consumers. Recommendations are made on potential usages and further research needs. Effective fortification depends on the selection of technically feasible and efficacious strategies. Once suitable strategies have been identified, cost becomes very important in selecting the best approach to implement. However it is essential to calculate cost in relation to the amount of bioavailable iron delivered. An approach to the calculation of cost using a conservative estimate of the enhancing effects of the innovative technologies discussed in the supplement is given in the final section.",p
Analytical methods for Bacillus cereus and other Bacillus species.,"Bacillus cereus can give rise to two distinct forms of foodborne disease, the emetic and the diarrhoeal syndromes. The emetic syndrome is believed to be associated with an emetic toxin pre-formed in food. Cooked rice is the most common vehicle, and the symptoms are similar to those of Staphylococcus aureus intoxication. The diarrhoeal type is caused by an enterotoxin and the symptoms generally parallel those of the Clostridium perfringens food poisoning. The heat resistance of B. cereus spores and the non-fastidious nature of the organism facilitates its survival and/or growth in a wide variety of foods. This review describes analytical methods available for the isolation, identification, and enumeration of the organism, in addition to details about biological and immunological methods for toxin assay. Data are also presented concerning the incidence and epidemiology of B. cereus food poisoning around the world, and especially in Japan.",p
Microbiological standards and handling codes for chilled and frozen foods. A review.,"The usefulness of microbiological standards for frozen foods is now a controversy in the trade and scientific literature. Most reviewers have given arguments both for and against, and have concluded that they should be applied with great caution. Such standards have the advantage of putting questions of safety on a convenient numerical basis. Canadian workers have reported that promulgation of standards has invariably raised the hygienic level of the products controlled. Bacteriological standards have often been associated with the question of safety to the consumer. Everyone recognizes that food poisoning bacteria are a potential danger in any food. But many have argued that the history of food poisoning outbreaks from frozen foods is excellent and that there is no need for standards; on the other hand, proponents of standards have pointed to the incomplete investigation and reporting of outbreaks, and have argued that there may be more outbreaks than we realize. They have pointed to laboratory studies that have shown grossly mishandled precooked frozen foods to be truly dangerous. Some have proposed that pathogens should be absent from foods; but others have questioned that a microbiological standard can accomplish this end. Some pathogens, such as Salmonella or Staphylococcus have been shown to be so ubiquitous that their presence in some commercial foods is unavoidable. Also, sampling and analytical methods have been described as inadequate to guarantee that pathogens present will be detected. Some have argued that control at the source is a better way-through inspections of the plant operation, by enforcement of handling codes, or by processing procedures such as pasteurization, which would be more certain to result in a pathogen-free food.A most important part of any of the proposed standards is a ""total count"" of viable aerobic bacteria. English workers have found that foods causing poisoning outbreaks usually had total viable counts above 10 million per gram. On the other hand, these same workers found Salmonella on meats with very low total viable count. The assumption by many that low total count indicates safety has been shown to be not always true. Furthermore, high counts of nonpathogenic organisms, such as psychrophilic saprophytes would have no public health significance. The relation between bacterial level and quality is open to less controversy. Some authorities have pointed to bacterial level as a measure of sanitation, adequacy of refrigeration, or speed of handling. Others have indicated that to determine which of these factors caused a high count would be impossible with only a total count on the product as a guide. Some investigators have said a high count affects flavor adversely before actual spoilage is evident, and this may be a factor in competition on today's market. It is well established that initial bacterial level will affect the shelf-life of a chilled product. Methods of analysis are more nearly adequate for counts than for pathogens, but they need improvement, and should be clearly specified as part of any bacteriological standard. Foods with high count could sometimes be brought into compliance merely by storing them for a sufficient period frozen, or by heating them slightly. This has been cited by some authors as a disadvantage of bacteriological standards. The enterococci and the coliform group (except Escherichia coli) have been shown to be ubiquitous and therefore should not be used alone to indicate fecal contamination. Although E. coli has greater significance, its source should be determined each time it is found. Various reviewers have expressed the need for caution in the application of standards. The principal precautionary arguments we have found are as follows:1) A single set of microbiological standards should not be applied to foods as a miscellaneous group, such as ""frozen foods"" or ""precooked foods.""2) Microbiological standards should be applied first to the more hazardous types of foods on an individual basis, after sufficient data are accumulated on expected bacterial levels, with consideration of variations in composition, processing procedures, and time of frozen storage.3) When standards are chosen, there should be a definite relation between the standard and the hazard against which it is meant to protect the public.4) Methods of sampling and analysis should be carefully studied for reliability and reproducibility among laboratories, and chosen methods should be specified in detail as part of the standard.5) Tolerances should be included in the standard to account for inaccuracies of sampling and analysis.6) At first, the standard should be applied on a tentative basis to allow for voluntary compliance before becoming a strictly enforced regulation.7) Microbiological standards will be expensive to enforce.8) If standards are unwisely chosen they will not stand in courts of law.",p
Taste-active components in some foods: a review of Japanese research.,"Japanese research of taste-active components in seafoods, meat and tomatoes is reviewed. The omission (or addition) test with synthetic extracts simulating natural extracts was employed in most of that research. In abalone, sea-urchin, snow crab, scallop and short-necked clam, glutamic acid (Glu) and glycine were recognized commonly to be taste-active. It was also reported that the synergism between Glu and 5'-ribonucleotides and the presence of sodium and chloride ions were required to produce the characteristic taste of each food. In dried skipjack meat and salted salmon eggs, umami substances such as Glu and inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) were found to be important contributors to their tastes as well. The brothy taste of beef, pork and chicken soups could be reproduced by free amino acids, IMP and sodium chloride, indicating their important roles in producing the taste. A potential effect of Glu and aspartic acid on the taste of tomatoes was observed. Studies of the flavor-enhancing effects on soups and umami solutions of sulfur-containing compounds in garlic are also described.",p
Estrogen deficiency symptom management in breast cancer survivors in the changing context of menopausal hormone therapy.,"Vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause or cancer therapies represent an increasingly common problem for breast cancer survivors given the increasing use of ovarian suppression in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women. Although estrogen and/or progestin effectively reduce vasomotor symptoms, a recent Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trial identified an unfavorable risk/benefit balance on life-threatening diseases, including increased breast cancer, for combined estrogen plus progestin use in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women. As a result, use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for chronic disease risk reduction in any population cannot be supported. In addition, the safety of estrogen and/or progestin regarding risk of recurrence or new cancer development in breast cancer survivors has not been demonstrated. For vasomotor symptoms in this population, neuroendocrine agents, including selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or gabapentin, are reasonable choices with substantial impact on hot flashes and moderate toxicity profiles. When rigorously evaluated, most other nonhormonal pharmacologic and herbal interventions have been found to have either modest or no efficacy and/or limiting toxicity. In breast cancer survivors even local vulvar/vaginal symptoms are best treated by nonhormone products since drug absorption with systemic estrogen-like effects has been reported. Estrogen/progestin use in breast cancer survivors should be considered only for women with severe vasomotor symptoms refractory to other approaches after extensive informed decision-making including review of current Food and Drug Administration labeling concerns with use limited to the lowest dose and shortest duration possible.",p
Agonistic behavior in food animals: review of research and techniques.,"One type of social behavior--agonistic behavior--is commonly observed among food animals. Agonistic behaviors are those behaviors which cause, threaten to cause or seek to reduce physical damage. Agonistic behavior is comprised of threats, aggression and submission. While any one of these divisions of agonistic behavior may be observed alone, they usually are found, in sequence, from the start to the end of an interaction. Food animals may show interspecific or intraspecific agonistic behaviors. Interspecific agonistic behavior has not been extensively studied but it is agriculturally important because farm workers may become injured or killed by aggressive food animals. Types of intraspecific agonistic behavior are: when animals are brought together, intermale fighting, resource defense, inter-gender fighting and aberrant aggression. Common pitfalls in research on agonistic behavior among food animals include too few replicates to detect a biological difference, the assumptions of the analysis are not met, only aggression and not submission or other agonistic behavior components are measured, incomplete description of the behaviors are reported and a complete, quantitive ethogram did not form the basis for selecting behavioral measures.",p
The high-fat Greek diet: a recipe for all?,"OBJECTIVE
To examine critically the published results of dietary surveys on the fat content of the Greek diet, and to assess its evolution and its relationship to the health of the Greeks. To consider the implications of these findings for current views on the nature and health implications of the traditional Mediterranean diet and how best to define it for use in modern policy making.


DESIGN
A systematic review of the literature on food consumption in Greece.


SETTING
Greece.


RESULTS
The first fully published data on the fat content of the Greek diet-the Seven Countries Survey-relates only to a small number of adult males in Crete and Corfu; the legitimacy of extrapolating these results to the rest of Greece is questioned. Earlier studies and chemical validation of intakes point to a lower fat content of the traditional diet than that inferred for Crete. Nearly all later surveys relate only to urban groups in Athens (mostly case-control hospital-based samples) and a variety of non-representative Cretan groups. Only two studies are larger and more representative, but one uses FAO food balance-sheets to reflect the national diet, and the other surveyed school-age children in three out of the 52 Greek counties. Unfortunately recent dietary studies have proved unreliable, given the continuing lack of national food composition tables with survey methods which proved inaccurate for dietary fat content. A progressive upward trend in total and saturated fat intake appears to have occurred with all health indicators in relation to fat indicating remarkable increases in adult and childhood obesity with attendant progressive deterioration in cardiovascular mortality and its risk factors, ie hypertension and diabetes. These data emphasise the need to alter current nutritional advice in Greece, particularly when it focuses on the promotion of olive oil and a high-fat diet.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings reaffirm low-moderate fat policies for optimum health, within which olive oil can be an important component of the diet.",p
Determination of aflatoxins in food products by chromatography.,"Several chromatographic methods for the determination of aflatoxins in agricultural and food products are reviewed. During the past two decades, identification and determination of aflatoxins were done by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) because it was easy, fast and inexpensive. However, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using fluorescence detection is now the method of choice for determining aflatoxins and is also growing in popularity for their identification. The reasons for selecting HPLC over TLC can be summarized as the ability to analyze for a wide variety of compounds, including compounds that are easily degraded by heat, light or air, the ease of adaptation to confirmatory procedures, the potential for automation and the dramatic improvement in instrumentation, including the development of increasingly sensitive fluorescence and electrochemical detectors and short, high-resolution, reversed-phase columns.",p
"Strategies for the determination of bioactive phenols in plants, fruit and vegetables.","Analytical strategies dealing with bioactive phenols in plants and foods are reviewed. These depend on the purpose of the analysis which may be classified as studies where the principal purpose is biological screening, phytochemical and/or chemical screening. Nevertheless, extraction of the phenol from the sample matrix is common and methods of achieving a suitable extract are assessed. Advances in the separation sciences and spectrometry are exploited for identification and quantification of isolated phenols. The various procedures are summarized and some typical ""case studies"" are presented. Two important areas are introduced briefly. Thus, plant phenols are reactive species and their ultimate fate has been relatively neglected. Studies of bioactive compounds generate a considerable volume of data making data handling and informatics important topics that warrant a separate review.",p
The role of nutrition in sickness and in health.,"This article reviews the importance of food and water for survival and the wide ranges of nutrient intake capable of sustaining reproduction and growth. It also reviews the different types of adverse reactions to foods including hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, pharmacologic and metabolic adverse responses to foods, and natural and industrial toxins in the food chains. The article concludes with recommendations for dealing with patients who advocate the use of ""natural"" foods and products.",p
Correlation of initial food reactions to observed reactions on challenges.,"BACKGROUND
Food allergies occur in 2% to 3% of the pediatric population. These reactions can vary from mild cutaneous manifestations to severe life-threatening reactions. Limited information is available on which specific factors may predict the severity of subsequent reactions.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether the organ system or the specific food involved in the initial allergic reaction predicts the outcome of subsequent food challenge.


METHODS
Retrospective review of all food sensitive children who underwent food challenges at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, in a 5-year period (n = 998 challenges). The specific food, initial symptom on presentation, and reaction on open challenges were recorded.


RESULTS
A total of 413 of 998 food challenges produced positive results. Milk, egg, and peanut were the most common foods to be associated with a positive challenge result. The most common presentation of food allergy was cutaneous followed by multiorgan reactions. Peanut, milk, and egg sensitivities were more likely to cause a multiple-organ system reaction on challenge than wheat or other foods. Patients with egg allergy were more likely to have a different reaction on rechallenge than other foods.


CONCLUSIONS
Milk, egg, and peanut are the most common foods associated with food challenges. Patients will typically experience similar reaction on re-exposure to the initial reaction. However, multiple-organ system reactions can occur after any initial clinical presentation, with milk, egg, and peanut having more multiple-organ reactions than other foods.",p
The chemistry of oxazoles and oxazolines in foods.,"This review attempts to present and discuss the current status of oxazoles and oxazolines relative to foods.

Food intake regulation in children. Fat and sugar substitutes and intake.,"A series of experiments exploring children's responsiveness to manipulations of energy density and macronutrient content of foods have been reviewed to assess the nutritional impact of macronutrient substitutes on children's intake. In these experiments, the focus is on the extent to which the energy content of foods was a salient factor influencing children's food intake, and macronutrient substitutes were used as tools to investigate this issue. Therefore, although several different macronutrient substitutes have been used in this research, we do not have a parametric set of experiments systematically assessing the impact of a variety of macronutrient substitutes. Given this, what can we conclude from the existing data? When the energy density and macronutrient content of foods is altered through the use of macronutrient substitutes that reduce the energy content of foods, children tend to adjust for the missing energy, although this adjustment may be partial and incomplete. This suggests the possibility that when macronutrient substitutes are used to reduce the energy content of foods, children's energy intake may be reduced. This adjustment, however, will most likely be less than a ""calorie for calorie"" reduction. In addition, even among young children, there are individual differences in the extent to which children adjust their intake in response to macronutrient and energy manipulations. The data are more extensive and particularly clear for cases in which CHO manipulations are used to alter energy density, but there is evidence for adjustments in energy intake in response to alterations of the fat content of the diet. The compensation for energy is not macronutrient specific; that is, when the fat content of food is reduced to reduce energy density of foods, children do not selectively consume fat in subsequent meals. This means that manipulations of macronutrient content of foods that reduce foods' energy content may not result in alterations of energy intake, but because these adjustments in energy intake are not macronutrient specific, changes in the overall macronutrient composition of children's diets can be obtained. There does not appear to be anything unique or special about the effects of macronutrient substitutes on children's intake; their effects are similar to those produced by other manipulations of macronutrient and energy content accomplished without macronutrient substitutes (e.g., augmenting foods with fat or carbohydrate to produce macronutrient differences). The research also indicates that under conditions that minimize adult attempts to control how much and what children eat, children can adjust their food and energy intake in response to the alterations of macronutrient and energy content of foods. Whether or not young children adjust food intake to compensate for energy-density changes depends upon their opportunity to control their own food intake as opposed to having their intake controlled by others. Young children's ability to adjust intake in response to alterations in the energy density of foods can be readily disrupted by the imposition of controlling child-feeding practices that attempt to regulate what and how much children eat. We believe that early experiences, including child-feeding practices imposed by parents, are major factors contributing to the etiology of individual differences and gender differences in the behavioral controls of food intake that can occur in response to the energy content of foods. The extent to which children respond to energy density of the diet has major implications for the effects of fat and sugar substitutes on children's intake. If children who are responsive to energy density consume substantial amounts of foods containing macronutrient substitutes, they should show some adjustments in intake to compensate for reduced energy, so that the impact of macronutrient substitutes on energy intake may be relatively small. However, changes in macronutrient com",p
Occurrence of nitroso compounds in fungi-contaminated foods: a review.,"Dimethylnitrosamine (NDMA), diethylnitrosamine (NDEA), methylbenzylnitrosamine, and a new N-nitroso compound, N-3-methylbutyl-N-1-methylacetonylnitrosamine (NMAMBA), were found in cornbread that was inoculated with Fusarium moniliforme and underwent an incubation and the addition of a small amount of NaNO2. The carcinogenicity of NMAMBA was shown by the induction of forestomach carcinomas and liver tumors in mice and rats. Another new nitrosamine, N-2-methylpropyl-N-methylacetonyl nitrosamine, was isolated in millet and wheat flour after similar treatment. Some species of fungi not only can reduce nitrates to nitrites but also can increase the amount of secondary amines in the moldy foods and provide favorable conditions for the synthesis of nitrosamines. Some fungi may utilize primary amines to synthesize nitrosamines in appropriate culture mediums. Furthermore, the cornmeal may naturally contain trace amounts of nitrosamines, as detected by a gas chromatography/thermoenergy analyzer. Prolonged feeding of F. moniliforme-inoculated cornbread alone also induced the development of forestomach carcinoma in rats. This indicates the occurrence of potential carcinogens, perhaps certain Fusarium mycotoxins, in the moldy cornbread in addition to the carcinogenic nitrosamines. Another nitroso compound, Roussin red methylester (di-mu-methanethiolatotetranitrosodiiron) was found in pickled vegetables that are eaten daily in the Linxian (China) area. Roussin Red may provide NO-2 ions, which would react readily with secondary amines to form nitrosamines. Possibly this compound is a natural tumor promoter and is able to induce epithelial hyperplasia of the upper digestive tract and forestomach papilloma in treated mice. Also, trace amounts of NDMA, NDEA, and some other nitrosamines were found in the extract of pickled vegetables.",p
Predictive food microbiology for the meat industry: a review.,"Predictive food microbiology (PFM) is an emerging multidisciplinary area of food microbiology. It encompasses such disciplines as mathematics, microbiology, engineering and chemistry to develop and apply mathematical models to predict the responses of microorganisms to specified environmental variables. This paper provides a critical review on the development of mathematical modelling with emphasis on modelling techniques, descriptions, classifications and their recent advances. It is concluded that the role and accuracy of predictive food microbiology will increase as understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food becomes clearer. However the reliance of food microbiology on laboratory techniques and skilled personnel to determine process and food safety is still necessary.",p
"From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise
  through Online Reviews","  Recommending products to consumers means not only understanding their tastes,
but also understanding their level of experience. For example, it would be a
mistake to recommend the iconic film Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys
other action movies; rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy
it -- once they are ready. The same is true for beers, wines, gourmet foods --
or any products where users have acquired tastes: the `best' products may not
be the most `accessible'. Thus our goal in this paper is to recommend products
that a user will enjoy now, while acknowledging that their tastes may have
changed over time, and may change again in the future. We model how tastes
change due to the very act of consuming more products -- in other words, as
users become more experienced. We develop a latent factor recommendation system
that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience. We find that such
a model not only leads to better recommendations, but also allows us to study
the role of user experience and expertise on a novel dataset of fifteen million
beer, wine, food, and movie reviews.

The rocky road from roots to rice: a review of the changing food and nutrition situation in Papua New Guinea.,"Although it is not happening uniformly within the country, the adoption of a modern lifestyle by Papua New Guineans is affecting their food habits and choices. More and more people consume rice, tinned fish and tinned meat. In towns and in villages with easy access to urban centres, these food items comprise an ever increasing part of the diet. These dietary changes are leading to increases in the prevalence of chronic lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, hypertension and coronary heart disease. Although average calorie availability is similar in urban and rural sectors, at around 2600 kilocalories per person per day, the nutritional outcomes are different. This is mainly due to the higher energy density of the modern urban diet with a greater intake of fat and protein. The traditional diet is low in protein with rather high energy content from starchy root crops. Studies have shown that urban children tend to be taller and heavier than their rural counterparts and that the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher among adults in urban than in rural areas. Finally, across all income groups and geographical regions, more women than men are chronically undernourished.",p

Listeria monocytogenes--threat to a safe food supply: a review.,"Listeria monocytogenes can cause circling disease, encephalitis, meningitis, septicemia, and mastitis in dairy cattle. Shedding of the pathogen from the udder or contamination from the environment can lead to presence of L. monocytogenes in raw milk. Surveys indicate the pathogen is in about 4% of US raw milks. Although HTST pasteurization commonly inactivates L. monocytogenes, evidence suggests that under unusual circumstances minimal survival is possible. The pathogen grows well in liquid dairy products at 4 to 35 degrees C and achieves higher populations in chocolate than in unflavored milks. When present in cheese milk, growth of L. monocytogenes may be retarded but not stopped by lactic starter cultures. The pathogen is concentrated in the curd with only a small fraction of cells in milk appearing in whey. Once in curd, the behavior of the pathogen ranges from growth (feta cheese making) to death of most but not all cells (cottage cheese making). During ripening of cheese, the numbers of L. monocytogenes decrease gradually (as in Cheddar or Colby cheese), decrease precipitously early during ripening, and then stabilize (as in blue cheese) or increase markedly (as in Camembert cheese). Consumption of foods containing L. monocytogenes can lead to listeriosis in susceptible humans (adults with a compromised immune system), pregnant women, and infants). In large outbreaks of human listeriosis, mortality rates of ca. 30% are common.",p
Consumer food handling in the home: a review of food safety studies.,"Epidemiological data from Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand indicate that a substantial proportion of foodborne disease is attributable to improper food preparation practices in consumers' homes. International concern about consumer food safety has prompted considerable research to evaluate domestic food-handling practices. The majority of consumer food safety studies in the last decade have been conducted in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (48%) and in the United States (42%). Surveys (questionnaires and interviews), the most frequent means of data collection, were used in 75% of the reviewed studies. Focus groups and observational studies have also been used. One consumer food safety study examined the relationship between pathogenic microbial contamination from raw chicken and observed food-handling behaviors, and the results of this study indicated extensive Campylobacter cross-contamination during food preparation sessions. Limited information about consumers' attitudes and intentions with regard to safe food-handling behaviors has been obtained, although a substantial amount of information about consumer knowledge and self-reported practices is available. Observation studies suggest that substantial numbers of consumers frequently implement unsafe food-handling practices. Knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and self-reported practices did not correspond to observed behaviors, suggesting that observational studies provide a more realistic indication of the food hygiene actions actually used in domestic food preparation. An improvement in consumer food-handling behavior is likely to reduce the risk and incidence of foodborne disease. The need for the development and implementation of food safety education strategies to improve specific food safety behaviors is reviewed in this paper.",p
Application of ozone for enhancing the microbiological safety and quality of foods: a review.,"Ozone (O3) is a strong antimicrobial agent with numerous potential applications in the food industry. High reactivity, penetrability, and spontaneous decomposition to a nontoxic product (i.e., O2) make ozone a viable disinfectant for ensuring the microbiological safety of food products. Ozone has been used for decades in many countries and recently, the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of this gas has been reaffirmed in the United States. Ozone, in the gaseous or aqueous phases, is effective against the majority of microorganisms tested by numerous research groups. Relatively low concentrations of ozone and short contact time are sufficient to inactivate bacteria, molds, yeasts, parasites, and viruses. However, rates of inactivation are greater in ozone demand-free systems than when the medium contains oxidizable organic substances. Susceptibility of microorganisms to ozone also varies with the physiological state of the culture, pH of the medium, temperature, humidity, and presence of additives (e.g., acids, surfactants, and sugars). Ozone applications in the food industry are mostly related to decontamination of product surface and water treatment. Ozone has been used with mixed success to inactivate contaminant microflora on meat, poultry, eggs, fish, fruits, vegetables, and dry foods. The gas also is useful in detoxification and elimination of mycotoxins and pesticide residues from some agricultural products. Excessive use of ozone, however, may cause oxidation of some ingredients on food surface. This usually results in discoloration and deterioration of food flavor. Additional research is needed to elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of microbial inactivation by ozone and to optimize its use in food applications.",p
Scientific review of the Welfare Food Scheme.,"INTRODUCTION
The COMA Panel on Maternal and Child Nutrition has undertaken the first scientific review of the Welfare Food Scheme since its inception in 1940. It has: reviewed current dietary recommendations, identified from national data, population groups vulnerable to adverse nutritional outcomes, evaluated the contribution of the current scheme to prevention of these vulnerabilities and identified further information needs and highlighted improvements likely to be cost neutral.


HISTORY AND ENTITLEMENT
Originally the Scheme incorporated universal provision. Subsequently it was targeted at the most socio-economically vulnerable. Today, a quarter of children under five are beneficiaries by virtue of their family's income. The Scheme has two principal beneficiary groups: pregnant women, mothers and young chidren in families eligible for certain social security benefits. With the exception of children under one year of age, all are entitled to a pint of milk a day (using redeemable milk tokens) and free vitamin supplements (available from designated clinics). Infant formula instead of milk is available for infants who are not breastfed. children under five years attending Scheme-registered day care facilities can receive one third of a pint of milk a day. Children aged 5-16 years not registered at school by virtue of mental or physical disability are entitled to a pint of milk a day.


CURRENT DIET AND VULNERABLE GROUPS
The following adverse nutritional outcomes were considered: pregnant women and mothers low uptake of periconceptional folic acid supplements low dietary intake during pregnancy vitamin D deficiency.",p

Effects of microwave cooking/reheating on nutrients and food systems: a review of recent studies.,"Microwave-oven technology has been improved by the use of low power. With the utilization of low-power techniques, studies showed equal or better retention of nutrients for microwave, as compared with conventional, reheated foods for thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, folacin, and ascorbic acid. Beef roasts microwaved at ""simmer"" were comparable with conventionally cooked roasts in sensory quality, while vegetables cooked by an institutional (1,150 w) microwave oven were superior to those cooked in a domestic (550 w) microwave oven. Microwave-cooked bacon had lower levels of nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon; however, the use of a new alpha-tocopherol coating system has been found to be a safe N-nitrosamine inhibitor regardless of cooking method used.",p
Mutagenicity of arylmethane dyes in Salmonella.,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities.",p

Medical device review at the Food and Drug Administration: lessons from magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biliary lithotripsy.,"Medical devices marketed in the United States must satisfy FDA standards of safety and effectiveness. Many observers have criticized the FDA medical device review process as both time consuming and unpredictable. In this note, Lawrence Makow examines the Agency's treatment of two novel medical technologies, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biliary extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. He concludes that the outcomes of these cases exemplify the mismatch between clinical utility and FDA approval status that has prompted concerns about lack of predictability. Mr. Makow asserts that this mismatch results from the FDA's implementation of the medical device statute rather than from the statute itself. He proposes an asymmetric standard for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new medical devices. While the safety showing would always require a high burden of proof, the efficacy standard would vary depending on the relationship between the device's safety and efficacy. Under this asymmetric standard, the FDA could better manage its workload and achieve more predictable results without sacrificing the public interest in avoiding injury from unproven medical devices.",p
Experience with cholelithiasis in patients with sickle cell disease in Nigeria.,"Sickle cell anemia, like other chronic hemolytic states, predisposes to cholelithiasis. However, it seems that other factors, apart from the consequent hyperbilirubinemia, contribute to this predisposition. This concept is supported by the fact that while cholelithiasis is very common among North American sickle cell patients, it is not so common in African patients. It is now believed that African sickle cell patients are protected from developing gallstones because of their low dietary intake of cholesterol and low intake of refined fiber-depleted foods. A review of all the published work on cholelithiasis, in Nigerians in general and sickle cell patients in particular, is presented in this article. A comparison is made with similar studies carried out in North America.",p
Is the variational scope of individual sensitivity given enough consideration in evaluation of risks caused by toxicological substances in food?,"The contemporary concept of evaluation of risks with humans caused by xenobiotics in food is critically reviewed. In this context it is pointed out that epidemiologic studies, in most cases, give little reliable evidence only. Mankind's risk factors are of a multi-dimensional composition, depending on genetic aspects and the differring health and nutrition statuses of the individuals. This leads to an enormously wide scope of variations in the individual sensitivity to xenobiotics. Contemporary knowledge leaves the question open, whether predisposed population groups are always sufficiently protected by the level of the permissible amount of xenobiotics.",p
"The effect of vegetarian diet, plant foods, and phytochemicals on hemostasis and thrombosis.","Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is multifactorial with a complex etiology. Conventional risk factors including serum lipids account for less than one half of future IHD events. In the past few years, novel risk factors such as hemostatic and thrombotic factors contributing to the development and progression of IHD have been explored. Typically, diet is the first line of consideration in the prevention of IHD, but very little is known about the effect of diet and nutrients on hemostasis and thrombosis. Cross-sectional studies indicate that vegetarians may have a lower concentration of certain markers of hemostasis compared with nonvegetarians. Platelet aggregation, an index of thrombosis, appears to be higher among vegetarians than nonvegetarians, perhaps because of the lower intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids among vegetarians. Monounsaturated-fat-rich plant foods may have a protective role in hemostasis and may explain in part the lower incidence of IHD in Mediterranean countries where residents consume a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acid. Finally, certain fruits and vegetables such as soy, garlic, and purple grapes may have antithrombotic effects, which may in part be due to the phytochemicals in these foods. Although this review suggests that a plant-based diet with sufficient n-3 fatty acids and certain fruits and vegetables may have a favorable impact on hemostasis and thrombosis, the evidence is neither sufficient nor conclusive at this time to warrant specific recommendations for the public. Clearly, much remains to be done in this area of investigation.",p
Review of the occurrence and formation of non-volatile N-nitroso compounds in foods.,A review of the literature published prior to July 1991 covers the occurrence and formation of non-volatile N-nitrosamines occurring in foods and beverages. The presence of identified volatile and non-volatile N-nitrosamines accounts for less than 10% of the total apparent N-nitrosamine concentration. N-Nitrosoproline and N-nitrosothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid are the most commonly identified non-volatile N-nitrosamines in the diet. Non-volatile N-nitrosamines account for 12 of the 21 currently identified N-nitroso compounds in foods and beverages.,p
The preparation of soy-bean foods for use in rural communities of the developing world.,"Since the beginning of 1970, there has been a great breakthrough in the popularization of soy-bean-based food in Nigeria and in many parts of the developing world, especially for use in the prevention of kwashiorkor. Since 1975, soy bean has become a main source of daily dietary protein in many parts of Nigeria as a result of the successful incorporation of soy-bean products into almost all traditional Nigerian foods. This is a review of previous work in Nigeria on eliminating the beany flavour, bitter taste, and flatus factors in soy-bean milk and cooked soy-bean paste preparations.",p
Arctic indigenous women consume greater than acceptable levels of organochlorines.,"Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides through traditional food resources was examined for Arctic Indigenous women living in two cultural and environmental areas of the Canadian Arctic--one community representing Baffin Island Inuit in eastern Arctic and two communities representing Sahtú Dene/Métis in western Arctic. Polychlorinated biphenyls, toxaphene, chlorobenzenes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, chlordane-related compounds and dieldrin were determined in local food resources as normally prepared and eaten. Quantified dietary recalls taken seasonally reflected normal consumption patterns of these food resources by women in three age groups: 20-40 y, 41-60 y and > or = 61 y. There was wide variation of intake of all organochlorine contaminants in both areas and among age groups for the Sahtú. Fifty percent of the intake recalls collected from the Baffin Inuit exceeded the acceptable daily intake for chlordane-related compounds and toxaphene, and a substantial percentage of the intake records for dieldrin and polychlorinated biphenyls exceeded the acceptable or tolerable daily intake levels. Primary contributing foods to organochlorine contaminants intake for the Baffin Inuit were meat and blubber of ringed seal, blubber of walrus and mattak and blubber of narwal. Important foods contributing organochlorine contaminant to the Sahtú Dene/Métis were caribou, whitefish, inconnu, trout and duck. The superior nutritional benefits and potential health risks of traditional food items are reviewed, as are implications for monitoring organochlorine contaminant contents of food, clinical symptoms and food use.",p

Food for thought: a critique on the hypothesis that endogenous cholecystokinin acts as a physiological satiety factor.,"This review evaluates the various lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the small intestine during feeding plays a physiological satiety. Issues considered include, the effects of systemic injection of CCK on consummatory and operant feeding, the role of the vagus nerve, the effects of CCKB receptor antagonists, and the neuroendocrine responses to exogenous CCK. A critical appraisal of this research indicates that while it is clearly demonstratable that exogenous peripheral CCK can alter food intake by acting on CCKA receptors, the mechanism involved may be more closely related to the induction if aversion and nausea, rather than satiety. With regard to peripheral endogenous CCK, the available evidence also does not seem to support a role for the hormone in satiety. In particular, it is doubtful whether plasma concentrations of CCK following a meal are sufficiently high to inhibit feeding. Moreover, CCKA receptor antagonist which do not cross the blood brain barrier fail to increase meal size, as would be expected if peripheral CCK was an effective satiety factor. In addition, the recent literature concerned with the possibility that CCK may have a direct action within the brain in the control of food intake has been reviewed. These studies show that CCK administered intracerebroventicularly, or by micoinjection into discrete brain regions, also inhibits feeding via a CCKA receptor mechanism. However, the physiological relevance of these findings have yet to be determined.",p
Food choice and the US dietary goals.,"Nobody has a completely free choice of food, but we may be so used to the limits of our choice that we are not aware of them. The purpose of this paper is to review proposals which have been put to the US Government and which, if followed through, would change the boundaries of food choice. To begin with, therefore, the framework of food choice is briefly considered. The paper falls into three parts: a general discussion on food choice, a review of the US proposals, and a discussion of their implications.",p
Selected lower-fat foods positively impact nutrient quality in diets of free-living Americans.,"OBJECTIVE
To compare nutrient profiles of Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) respondents who reported use of regular and lower-fat versions of selected foods with those not reporting intake of these foods.


SUBJECTS
American children (ages 2 to 19) and adults completing two days of recalls for the 1994 to 1996 CSFII.


DESIGN
Dietary intakes were reviewed for selected foods for which regular (high) and modified-fat versions were available. Foods included added table fats (eg, salad dressings, margarine, creams), desserts, snacks, cheeses, and yogurts. Respondents were divided into non-users (none of these foods reported), mixed users (lower-fat and high-fat foods), and high-fat (only) users.


STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED
Weighted data were used for descriptive analyses. Unweighted data were used for reported nutrient intake, nutrient density, fat intakes, and Food Guide Pyramid comparisons. A P value of < or =.01 was selected to determine whether group differences were statistically significant. Post hoc analyses were conducted to identify where differences were found.


RESULTS
Respondents reporting inclusion of any selected lower-fat food had significantly lower fat intake (P<.01) than exclusive high-fat users (male respondents: 31.5% vs 35.1%; female respondents: 30.3% vs 34.4%; children: 30.6% vs 33.4%). In general, mixed users had higher micronutrient intakes than high-fat users. Specifically, mixed users reported higher intakes of most B vitamins; vitamins A, C, and folate; the minerals calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and zinc; and fiber. These differences were associated with higher intakes of milk, fruits, and grains.


APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS
This research supports the ""all foods can fit"" paradigm and validates recommending lower-fat foods (including snacks, desserts, cheeses, yogurt, and added table fats) to American consumers to reduce total fat to moderate levels while ensuring adequacy for most micronutrients.",p
Effect of sensory perception of foods on appetite and food intake: a review of studies on humans.,"OBJECTIVE
How much do the sensory properties of food influence the way people select their food and how much they eat? The objective of this paper is to review results from studies investigating the link between the sensory perception of food and human appetite regulation.


CONTENT OF THE REVIEW
The influence of palatability on appetite and food intake in humans has been investigated in several studies. All reviewed studies have shown increased intake as palatability increased, whereas assessments of the effect of palatability using measures of subjective appetite sensations have shown diverging results, for example, subjects either feel more hungry and less full after a palatable meal compared to a less palatable meal, or they feel the opposite, or there is no difference. Whether palatability has an effect on appetite in the period following consumption of a test meal is unclear. Several studies have investigated which sensory properties of food are involved in sensory-specific satiety. Taste, smell, texture and appearance-specific satieties have been identified, whereas studies on the role of macronutrients and the energy content of the food in sensory-specific satiety have given equivocal results. Different studies have shown that macronutrients and energy content play a role in sensory-specific satiety or that macronutrients and energy content are not a factor in sensory-specific satiety. Sensory-specific satiety may have an important influence on the amount of food eaten. Studies have shown that increasing the food variety can increase food and energy intake and in the short to medium term alter energy balance. Further knowledge about the importance of flavour in appetite regulation is needed, for example, which flavour combinations improve satiety most, the possible connection between flavour intensity and satiety, the effect of persistence of chemesthetic sensation on palatability and satiety, and to what extent genetic variation in taste sensitivity and perception influences dietary habits and weight control.",p
"Effect of gamma irradiation on Listeria monocytogenes in frozen, artificially contaminated sandwiches.","Gamma irradiation has been shown to effectively control L monocytogenes in uncooked meats but has not been extensively studied in ready-to-eat foods. The presence of Listeria in ready-to-eat foods is often due to postprocess contamination by organisms in the food-manufacturing environment. Because gamma irradiation is applied after products are packaged, the treated foods are protected from environmental recontamination. Currently, a petition to allow gamma irradiation of ready-to-eat foods is under review by the Food and Drug Administration. This study was conducted to determine if gamma irradiation could be used to control L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat sandwiches. Ham and cheese sandwiches were contaminated with L. monocytogenes, frozen at -40 degrees C, and exposed to gamma irradiation. Following irradiation, sandwiches were assayed for L. monocytogenes. A triangle test was performed to determine if irradiated and nonirradiated sandwiches differed in sensory quality. We found that the D10-values ranged from 0.71 to 0.81 kGy and that a 5-log reduction would require irradiation with 3.5 to 4.0 kGy. The results of a 39-day storage study of sandwiches inoculated with 10(7) CFU of L monocytogenes per g indicated that counts for nonirradiated sandwiches remained fairly constant. Counts for sandwiches treated with 3.9 kGy decreased by 5 log units initially and then decreased further during storage at 4 degrees C. Sensory panelists could distinguish between irradiated and nonirradiated sandwiches but were divided on whether irradiation adversely affected sandwich quality. Our results suggest that manufacturers of ready-to-eat foods could use gamma irradiation to control L. monocytogenes and improve the safety of their products.",p

Peripheral signals in the control of satiety and hunger.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Food intake is critical for survival and is a complex behavior with multiple levels of control. Short-term, meal-related signals arise from many sources including the gastrointestinal tract, the environment, and higher centers in the brain. As described in this review, inputs from the gastrointestinal tract can exert potent effects on meal initiation, meal termination, and meal frequency. The complex array of signals generated from the gastrointestinal system and from adipose tissue, which participate in the regulation of food intake, and specifically how these signals relate to satiety and hunger, is the focus of this review.


RECENT FINDINGS
Literature on the role of the well-studied gastrointestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, in satiety, in addition to its interaction with long-term adiposity signals in mediating food intake will be reviewed. In addition, literature on the gastrointestinal hormones glucagon-like-peptide 1, apolipoprotein A-IV and peptide YY, and how they may act to regulate satiety, is described. Finally, the newly discovered hormone, ghrelin, and how it relates to meal initiation and hunger is discussed.


SUMMARY
A better understanding of these systems and how they relate to body adiposity will prove to have important clinical applications. The available data suggest that interventions directed at multiple targets in the energy homeostasis system may be necessary to achieve and maintain weight loss.",p

Food safety: review and implications for dietitians and dietetic technicians.,"Section 103 (d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act directs the secretary of health and human services to identify, publish, and annually review a list of pathogens transmitted via food contaminated by infected food handlers. The secretary is also directed to publish means by which diseases on the list are transmitted. The intent of the list is to protect disabled food handlers when they become ill and to provide managers with information for determining when to remove or reassign disabled food handlers who have infectious or communicable diseases to jobs that do not involve handling food. Pathogens often transmitted via food contaminated by infected food handlers are Salmonella typhi, Shigella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, hepatitis A virus, and the Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses. This article discusses section 103 (d) and for each of the six pathogens describes characteristics and growth requirements, types of foods involved in outbreaks, factors that contribute to foodborne outbreaks, and prevention and control measures. Human beings are the only reservoir of Sal typhi. The source of Shigella species is the intestinal tract of human beings and other primates. Human beings are the common reservoir of Staph aureus and Strep pyogenes. Staph aureus is frequently found in the nose and on the skin of healthy people, whereas Strep pyogenes is carried in the throat of infected or asymptomatic carriers. Foodborne viruses of public health concern originate in the human intestine. Foods that favor the multiplication of Sal typhi are often foods that require no cooking. Many outbreaks of foodborne disease attributed to Shigella species and viruses have been associated with salads. Moist, high-protein, and salty foods that have been cooked are most often involved in outbreaks of staphylococcal foodborne illness. Foods usually implicated in Strep pyogenes outbreaks are predominately composed of milk, eggs, or meat. Dietitians and dietetic technicians can use three approaches to reduce the incidence of foodborne disease attributed to food handlers: conducting training and education programs, implementing a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system, and supporting certification of foodservice managers.",p
Atempted homicide with arsenic.,"An unusual method of introducing arsenic to water with homicidal intentions, where five members of the same family were poisoned, is reported.

New trends in food processing.,"In this work some of the newest trends in food processing are reviewed. This revision intends to provide an updated overview (including works published until February 2001) on the newest food processes, including food manufacturing, preservation, and control. Modern processes for food and food ingredients manufacturing based on membrane technology, super-critical fluid technology, and some applications of biotechnology are presented, mainly applied to obtain functional foods, ""all-natural"" enriched foods, probiotics and prebiotics. Also included is a critical assessment concerning non-thermal preservation techniques used for food preservation, such as high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, ultrasound, pulsed light, hurdle systems, etc. Finally, a group of new analytical techniques (i.e., molecular techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), food image analysis, and biosensors) and their use for food and process control is reviewed.",p
Key elements of food contamination monitoring programmes.,"The key elements of programmes for monitoring food contamination are reviewed in relation to their purposes, scope and priorities. Attention is drawn to the requirements and quality assurance of procedures for sampling and analysis, and methods of handling and processing analytical surveillance data. The benefits to be derived from national monitoring programmes are improved food safety, warning of problems of contamination, provision of intake data for evaluation of health hazards, better management and use of natural resources, supply of data on environmental pollution and reliable information on food safety for the public, and provision of a means of checking the effectiveness of regulatory mechanisms and planning technological developments.",p
Algal biotoxins of marine origin: new indications from the European Union.,"Marine biotoxins, more or less complex molecules with various origins that can accumulate in the tissues of fish products through the food chain, are reviewed. The EU, aware of the danger incurred in eating certain fish products, has issued a set of hygiene and health directives for the purpose of preventing disease and safeguarding consumer health. In particular, directive 91/492/EEC, of 15 July 1991, lays down the sanitary norms applicable to the production and commercialization of live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods and regulates the whole system involving these products from their origin to consumption. More recently, through Commission Decision dated 15 March 2002 (EC OJ 175/62 of 16.3.2002) the EU has set new standards for the implementation of directive 91/492/EEC with respect to the maximum levels and analysis methods for some marine biotoxins.",p

At same time the possible variance in eating behavior compatible with good health requires consideration. The IUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences) FHILL (Food Habits in Later Life) Project, comprises (1) a morbidity study on about 2,000 elderly in 13 communities (now available on CD Rom) and (2) a mortality follow-up study. In the morbidity study, a total health assessment score or Later Life Status Score (LLSS) has been considered in relation to non-nutritional and nutritional factors. The elderly Greek cohorts aged 70+ in Melbourne. Australia (M = 94, F = 95) and Spata, Greece (M = 51, F = 53) have been used as a model for multivariate analyses to determine separately the importance of non-nutritional (well-being, memory, general health, medication-use, activities of daily living, exercise, social activity and social networks scores) and nutritional variables (intake of food groups g/day, food group variety scores, nutrients) in accounting for LLSS. A mortality follow-up study on the elderly cohort in Spata, Greece has also been completed and published. The findings from these preliminary analyses on the Greek cohorts will be reviewed as an example of how food culture may be influencing both quality of life and survival in Greek elderly. The most important non-nutritional determinants of LLSS in Greeks included: mobility and independence (exercise and activities of daily living), well-being and memory (collectively explained 80% of the variation of LLSS). For nutritional variables, a high intake and variety of plant foods (in particular vegetables, legumes and fruit); a high intake and variety of seafood and a low intake of meat emerged with statistical and biological significance. Results from the mortality study also agree with findings from the morbidity study--particularly the importance of the overall traditional greek food culture, with its emphasis on plant derived food of various kinds, as opposed to individual food categories, in protecting against premature death. Strategies are advanced which may optimise nutritionally related health problems amongst the aged around the globe.",p
Diet in the irritable bowel syndrome.,"Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often request dietary recommendations. They must eat, and they want to know what to eat. Present national guidelines recommend dietary treatment with fiber for IBS patients with constipation. Diet recommendations are made based on symptoms. There may be different dietary recommendations for constipation, diarrhea, and pain or bloating. This article reviews the relationship of foods to IBS and issues of food intolerances and hypersensitivities, and recommendations for diet therapy. The role of dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble, is reviewed. Although there are few studies to substantiate exact diets, broad dietary plans are recommended for the different symptoms of IBS. In addition, the recent literature on probiotics and prebiotics pertinent to IBS is reviewed.",p
Arsenic speciation in humans and food products: a review.,"Although acute intoxication has become rare, arsenic (As) is still a dangerous pollution agent for industrial workers and people living in the vicinity of emission sources. In humans, only inorganic As is toxic; organic forms present in large amounts in the environment are nontoxic. It is therefore important to be able to differentiate one group from the other using appropriate speciation methods. The authors review the present knowledge of the distribution of As in humans and food products. The three steps of the speciation methods (sample preparation, species separation, and detection) are described. For liquid samples, a clean-up step (C18 cartridge extraction, dilution, or freezing) is necessary to eliminate proteins and salts from the matrix. For solid organic samples, the first step consists of the digestion of tissues followed by solvent extraction sometimes coupled with a C18 extraction. The separation of As species is accomplished by different high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods (ion-exchange, ion-pairing, and micellar liquid chromatography). The detection methods are compatible with HPLC and are able to detect As species in the microgram-per-liter range. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometry is more frequently used, but suffers from interference by organic solvents in the mobile phases. Atomic absorption spectrometry methods give sensitivities of the same order. ICP-mass spectrometry has the advantage of specificity and can be 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive than previous methods.",p
Free food or earned food? A review and fuzzy model of contrafreeloading,"Animals will work (e.g. lever press) for 'earned' food even though identical 'free' food can easily be obtained from a nearby dish. This phenomenon, called contrafreeloading, appears to contradict a basic tenet of most learning, motivation and optimal foraging theories; namely that animals strive to maximize the ratio of reward, or benefit, to effort, or cost. This paper reviews the factors that have been found to affect the level of contrafreeloading, to try to explain the behaviour. In experiments involving intensive training, contrafreeloading may be explained on the basis of secondary reinforcement and/or differential exposure to the alternative food sources. However, contrafreeloading also occurs without prior training. Contrafreeloading declines with increasing hunger and with increases in the effort required to obtain the earned food: it also has an inverted-U relationship with the degree of stimulus change associated with the earned food. A fuzzy logic model is developed to predict the outcome of interactions between these factors. The model successfully simulates previous empirical findings and provides novel, testable predictions. It is argued that contrafreeloading does not contradict reinforcement theory, provided that the sensory reinforcement obtained from stimuli associated with the earned food is also taken into account. A functional explanation of why such stimuli are reinforcing, and of contrafreeloading itself, is based upon the advantage of gathering information for animals living in changing environments (i.e. an information primacy model). Animals work for earned food in order to update their estimate of a currently sub-optimal food source because, in the longer term, it may unpredictably become the optimal place to feed. Contrafreeloading is therefore a behaviour that, under natural conditions, is adaptive.",p
Clinical features of 31 patients with systemic contact dermatitis due to the ingestion of Rhus (lacquer).,"In Korea, Rhus has been used as a folk medicine to cure gastrointestinal diseases and as a health food. We review the clinicopathological and laboratory findings in patients with systemic contact dermatitis caused by intake of Rhus. We reviewed medical records and histopathological sections from 31 patients during a 10-year period. The male/female ratio was 1.4: 1 and the average age was 43.8 years (range 22-70). Ten patients (32%) had a known history of allergy to lacquer. Rhus was ingested to treat gastrointestinal problems including indigestion and gastritis (45%), and as a health food (39%), in cooked meat, in herbal medicine, or taken by inhalation. The patients developed skin lesions such as a maculopapular eruption (65%), erythema multiforme (EM, 32%), erythroderma (19%), pustules, purpura, weals and blisters. Erythroderma was very frequent in patients with a known history of allergy to lacquer, but maculopapular and EM-type eruptions were more frequently observed in those without a history of allergy. All patients experienced generalized or localized pruritus. Other symptoms included gastrointestinal problems (32%), fever (26%), chills and headache; many developed leucocytosis (70%) with neutrophilia (88%), while some showed toxic effects on liver and kidney. Fifty-nine per cent of patients observed cutaneous or general symptoms within a day after ingestion of Rhus. There was no difference in the time lag for symptoms to develop between patients allergic and not allergic to Rhus. All patients responded well to treatment with systemic steroids and antihistamines. Common histopathological findings were vascular dilatation, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration, and extravasation of red blood cells in the upper dermis. Rhus lacquer should not be ingested in view of its highly allergic and toxic effects.",p
Irradiation as a method for decontaminating food. A review.,"Despite substantial efforts in avoidance of contamination, an upward trend in the number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by nonsporeforming pathogenic bacteria are reported in many countries. Good hygienic practices can reduce the level of contamination but the most important pathogens cannot presently be eliminated from most farms nor is it possible to eliminate them by primary processing, particularly from those foods which are sold raw. Several decontamination methods exist but the most versatile treatment among them is the processing with ionizing radiation. Decontamination of food by ionizing radiation is a safe, efficient, environmentally clean and energy efficient process. Irradiation is particularly valuable as an endproduct decontamination procedure. Radiation treatment at doses of 2-7 kGy--depending on condition of irradiation and the food--can effectively eliminate potentially pathogenic nonsporeforming bacteria including both long-time recognized pathogens such as Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus as well as emerging or ""new"" pathogens such as Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes or Escherichia coli O157:H7 from suspected food products without affecting sensory, nutritional and technical qualities. Candidates of radiation decontamination are mainly poultry and red meat, egg products, and fishery products. It is a unique feature of radiation decontamination that it can also be performed when the food is in a frozen state. With today's demand for high-quality convenience foods, irradiation in combination with other processes holds a promise for enhancing the safety of many minimally processed foods. Radiation decontamination of dry ingredients, herbs and enzyme preparations with doses of 3-10 kGy proved to be a viable alternative to fumigation with microbicidal gases. Radiation treatment at doses of 0.15-0.7 kGy under specific conditions appears to be feasible also for control of many foodborne parasites, thereby making infested foods safe for human consumption. Microorganisms surviving low- and medium-dose radiation treatment are more sensitive to environmental stresses or subsequent food processing treatments than the microflora of unirradiated products. Radiation treatment is an emerging technology in an increasing number of countries and more-and-more clearances on radiation decontaminated foods are issued or expected to be granted in the near future.",p
Drug interactions in psychiatric practice.,"The interaction of neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium and anxiolytic sedatives with other drugs and food is reviewed with special emphasis on drug interactions commonly encountered in psychiatric practice. Clinical relevance and mechanism of action of such interactions are discussed. An update of the interaction of lithium with prostaglandin inhibitors is presented.",p
Rapid microbiology: applications of bioluminescence in the food industry--a review.,"The bioluminescent assay of ATP is rapid and simple and may be used as an estimate of microbial numbers. It therefore shows great potential as a technique to provide information on the microbiological quality of a food within a few minutes, in comparison with conventional techniques, which provide results retrospectively. However, despite the advantages of speed and sensitivity, no food microbiologists are using the technique for routine quality control and hygiene monitoring. This review seeks to highlight the reasons for this, and to offer some ideas for future research to increase the acceptance of ATP assays within the food industry.",p
Methods for allergen analysis in food: a review.,"Food allergies represent an important health problem in industrialized countries. Undeclared allergens as contaminants in food products pose a major risk for sensitized persons. A proposal to amend the European Food Labelling Directive requires that all ingredients intentionally added to food products will have to be included on the label. Reliable detection and quantification methods for food allergens are necessary to ensure compliance with food labelling and to improve consumer protection. Methods available so far are based on protein or DNA detection. This review presents an up-to-date picture of the characteristics of the major food allergens and collects published methods for the determination of food allergens or the presence of potentially allergenic constituents in food products. A summary of the current availability of commercial allergen detection kits is given. One part of the paper describes various methods that have been generally employed in the detection of allergens in food; their advantages and drawbacks are discussed in brief. The main part of this review, however, focuses on specific food allergens and appropriate methods for their detection in food products. Special emphasis is given to allergenic foods explicitly mentioned in the Amendment to the European Food Labelling Directive that pose a potential risk for allergic individuals, namely celery, cereals containing gluten (including wheat, rye and barley) crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, milk and dairy products, mustard, tree-nuts, sesame seeds, and sulphite at concentrations of at least 10 mg kg(-1).

Nutrition and the commoditization of food in sub-Saharan Africa.,"During the past decade, Africa, more than any other continent, has been associated with famine and malnutrition. The Sahelian drought of the early 1970s, the Wollo and Karamoja famines and most recently, mass starvation in Ethiopia, have followed one another in rapid succession. The term 'food crisis' continually crops up in the popular and academic press. An increasing number of researchers probe possible causes; many seek a systemic reason for the present situation. One working hypothesis is that increasing commoditization of food has undermined Africa's food systems. This paper does not purport to prove or disprove this. Less ambitiously, its aim is to draw attention to inter-relationships between commoditization and physical and social aspects of African food systems, tracing their possible effects on the nutritional status of the African population. In so doing, some of the complexities of developing food production and consumption in the transition from peasant societies to more urban-based national economies become evident. The paper is divided into three main parts: a discussion of conceptual categories and general background information about sub-Saharan African food zones and commodity and factor markets; a review of literature on rural food availability and nutrition; and a review of urban food availability and nutrition.",p
Nutrition intervention program of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study: a self-management approach.,"OBJECTIVE
To characterize the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study nutrition intervention program by determining the frequency of intervention strategies used by the dietitians and the usefulness of program components as rated by participants.


DESIGN
Dietitians recorded which of 32 intervention strategies they used at each monthly visit. Participants rated the usefulness of 19 program components.


SUBJECTS
840 adults with renal insufficiency.


INTERVENTION
Participants were assigned randomly to usual-, low-, or very-low-protein diet groups. Each eating pattern also specified a phosphorus intake goal. Each participant met monthly with a dietitian for an average of 26 months.


STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Analyses of variance and chi 2 analyses.


RESULTS
Dietitians used the following intervention strategies most often in all groups: providing feedback based on self-monitoring and/or food records, reviewing adherence or biochemistry data, providing low-protein foods, and reviewing graphs of adherence progress. In general, the dietitians used feedback, modeling, and support strategies more often, and knowledge and skills strategies less often, with participants who had to make the greatest reductions in protein intake and those with more advanced disease. In all groups, the dietitians' use of knowledge and skills, feedback, and modeling strategies decreased over time (P < .001), whereas use of support strategies was maintained. The type and frequency of intervention strategies used by dietitians and the usefulness ratings of participants did not vary by educational level of the participant. Both self-monitoring and dietitian support were rated as ""very useful"" by 88% of the participants.


CONCLUSIONS
Three features were central to the MDRD Study nutrition intervention program: feedback, particularly from self-monitoring and from measures of adherence; modeling, particularly by providing low-protein food products; and dietitian support. We recommend the self-management approach.",p

Technology assessment of medical devices at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.,"We reviewed the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory process for medical devices and described the issues that arise in assessing device safety and effectiveness during the postmarket period. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), an organization within the Food and Drug Administration, has the legal authority and responsibility for ensuring that medical devices marketed in the United States are both reasonably safe and effective for their intended use. This is an enormous challenge given the diversity of medical devices and the large number of different types of devices on the market. Many scientific and regulatory activities are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness, including technology assessment, albeit in a manner quite different from that of conventional technology assessment. The basic approach taken at the CDRH to ensure device safety and effectiveness is to develop an understanding of the way in which a medical device works and how it will perform in clinical situations.",p
The need for special foods and sugar substitutes by individuals with diabetes mellitus.,"The need for special dietary products marketed for use by individuals with diabetes mellitus and the safety and efficacy of certain nutritive sweetener substitutes for sucrose are reviewed. Special foods for individuals with diabetes mellitus are not necessary to achieve the dietary objectives recommended by leading United States and European authorities. They can be achieved conveniently and at minimum expense through enlightened choices of commonly available food items. At present, specific and unique characteristics of food products with special therapeutic properties for diets of diabetic individuals cannot be delineated or defined on rational nutritional grounds. Such terms as ""diet"", ""dietetic"", and ""diabetic"" on food labels have no uniform meaning for consumers, and diabetologists have observed that patients tend to consume such foods without regard to their energy content. Some consumers regard the reduced-calorie and low-calorie prepared food products as convenient in diets for weight reduction and diabetes although their use in dietary management of diabetes has no therapeutic basis other than weight reduction and maintenance. When fed as pure substances to fasted subjects, the nonglucose carbohydrate nutritive sweeteners, fructose, xylitol, and sorbitol, are absorbed relatively slowly and produce less postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin response than sucrose or glucose. Adequate studies of their long-term effectiveness when ingested as part of mixed meals have not been conducted. Although these sucrose substitutes are generally considered safe, the significance of recent information on possible carcinogenicity of oral xylitol in long-term feeding studies has not been fully evaluated. In view of the lack of certain essential information on the long-term effectiveness of various diets in preventing or mitigating the chronic debilitating complication of diabetes, suggestions for future research are included.",p
Analytical methods for the determination of acrylamide in food products: a review.,"In early 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration reported high acrylamide levels in heat-treated carbohydrate-rich foods. Consequently, intensive activity began examining the many different types of food, and thousands of analyses have been undertaken world wide. Measurement data have been published in many different types of media. Within this flood of publications, there are only a limited number of articles concerned with the technical aspects of the measurements. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art in the analysis of acrylamide in foodstuffs. It covers information on methods from peer-reviewed articles and other sources (e.g. a survey carried out among official and private laboratories of the Member States of the European Union). Alternative methods are presented and discussed alongside the more common measurement techniques for acrylamide in foodstuffs. Special attention is given to sample preparation. The greatest differences between the analytical methods was for acrylamide extraction and clean-up. The influence of different extraction techniques or extraction solvents/solvent mixtures on the measurement results has not yet been fully investigated. There is also a lack of understanding about the sample clean-up. Since both might have a large impact on the results of the analysis, this review should also be considered as a basis for further investigations.",p
Palatability-dependent appetite and benzodiazepines: new directions from the pharmacology of GABA(A) receptor subtypes.,"This paper updates an early review on benzodiazepine-enhanced food intake, published in the first issue of Appetite, and describes the considerable advances since then in the pharmacology of benzodiazepines, their sites and mechanisms of action, and in understanding the psychological processes leading to the increase in food consumption. A great diversity of benzodiazepine receptor ligands have been developed, many of which affect food intake. Agonists can be divided into full agonists (which produce the full spectrum of benzodiazepine effects) and partial agonists (which are more selective in their effects). In addition, inverse agonists have been identified, with high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors but having negative efficacy: these drugs exhibit anorectic properties. Benzodiazepine receptors are part of GABA(A) receptor complexes, and ligands thereby modulate inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Molecular approaches have identified a palette of receptor subunits from which GABA(A) receptors are assembled. In all likelihood, benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia is mediated by the alpha2/alpha3 subtype not the alpha1 subtype. Novel alpha2/alpha3 selective compounds will test this hypothesis. A probable site of action in the caudal brainstem for benzodiazepines is the parabrachial nucleus. Behavioural evidence strongly indicates that a primary action of benzodiazepines is to enhance the positive hedonic evaluation (palatability) of tastes and foodstuffs. This generates the increased food intake and instrumental responding for food rewards. Therapeutic applications may derive from the actions of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists on food procurement and ingestion.",p
Exposure to styrene in the general Canadian population.,"As part of an environmental health assessment in Canada, estimates of the intake of styrene by the general population were derived. Concentrations of styrene reported in air, water, soil and foods in Canada were reviewed in detail. Data on ambient air, collected by Environment Canada, showed mean concentrations of 0.09-2.35 micrograms/m3 at 18 sites across the country. In a national pilot study of indoor air in 757 homes across Canada, the mean styrene concentration was found to be 0.28 microgram/m3. The range of mean concentrations of styrene in treated water from 80 supplies in Ontario's Drinking Water Surveillance Program was 0.050-0.250 microgram/L. In limited testing of uncontaminated urban soils in southern Ontario, the styrene levels were less than 10 micrograms/kg. In a small Canadian survey, the compound was not detected (limits of detection, 1.0 microgram/L for liquids and 0.005 microgram/g for solids) in composite samples of 34 groups of food purchased in Windsor, Ontario. On the basis of these monitoring data, daily intakes of styrene were estimated for the general population. Intakes from ambient air ranged from 0.004 to 0.17 microgram/kg body weight per day and those from indoor air from 0.07 to 0.10 microgram/kg body weight per day for various age groups: infants, toddlers, school-age children, teenagers and adults. Intake from food was calculated to range from < 0.11 to < 0.58 microgram/kg body weight per day. The estimated intakes from drinking-water and soil were negligible. Potential exposure from cigarette smoke, on the basis of the styrene reported in mainstream smoke (10 micrograms per cigarette) and a smoking rate of 20 cigarettes per day, was estimated to be 2.86 micrograms/kg body weight per day for adults.",p
Fiducia: A Personalized Food Recommender System for Zomato,"  This paper presents Fiducia, a food review system involving a pipeline which
processes restaurant-related reviews obtained from Zomato (India's largest
restaurant search and discovery service). Fiducia is specific to popular cafe
food items and manages to identify relevant information pertaining to each item
separately in the reviews. It uses a sentiment check on these pieces of text
and accordingly suggests an appropriate restaurant for the particular item
depending on user-item and item-item similarity. Experimental results show that
the sentiment analyzer module of Fiducia achieves an accuracy of over 85% and
our final recommender system achieves an RMSE of about 1.01 beating other
baselines.

Chlorzoxazone hepatotoxic reactions. An analysis of 21 identified or presumed cases.,"A drug rechallenge proved chlorzoxazone to be hepatotoxic in a patient who had been treated with a combination of it and acetaminophen (Parafon Forte) for several months. Failure to demonstrate a toxic response to acetaminophen coupled with a dramatic response to a single dose of chlorzoxazone implicated chlorzoxazone as the hepatotoxic agent. A review of US Food and Drug Administration records and cases reported in the medical literature disclosed 23 cases of chlorzoxazone-associated hepatotoxic reactions occurring since 1970. These cases were examined in terms of age, duration of therapy, other confounding etiologic factors, and ultimate outcome. There were two deaths involving hepatic failure. Reports of adverse reactions among six commonly used analgesic-muscle relaxants in Sweden have indicated a low, but comparatively greater, incidence of hepatotoxic reactions associated with a chlorzoxazone-containing compound.",p
Listeriosis and its transmission by food.,"Investigations of recent outbreaks and sporadic cases of listeriosis in North America and other countries have shown that the infection can be foodborne. Pregnant women and their fetuses, the elderly, and immuno-compromised individuals are at increased risk of listeriosis. Listeria monocytogenes, the causative bacterium, is widespread in nature and is found in many foods. It can grow at refrigerator temperatures and is resistant to adverse conditions and to several antibiotics. The generally low levels of the organism found in foods require procedures to optimize their detection and recovery. Occurrence and characteristics of the bacterium, virulence and disease symptoms, transmission to humans, incidence and behavior in foods, and means of controlling growth in foods are reviewed.",p
Robots in food systems: a review and assessment of potential uses.,"Management personnel in foodservice, food processing, and robot industries were surveyed to evaluate potential job functions for robots in the food industry. The survey instrument listed 64 different food-related job functions that participants were asked to assess as appropriate or not appropriate for robotic implementation. Demographic data were collected from each participant to determine any positive or negative influence on job function responses. The survey responses were statistically evaluated using frequencies and the chi-square test of significance. Sixteen of the 64 job functions were identified as appropriate for robot implementation in food industries by both robot manufacturing and food managers. The study indicated, first, that food managers lack knowledge about robots and robot manufacturing managers lack knowledge about food industries. Second, robots are not currently being used to any extent in the food industry. Third, analysis of the demographic data in relation to the 16 identified job functions showed no significant differences in responses.",p
A hospital outbreak of Clostridium perfringens food poisoning--implications for food hygiene review in hospitals.,"An outbreak of Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) food poisoning affected 17 of 44 (38.6%) patients interviewed on two hospital wards. A case-control study showed a statistically significant association between the consumption of roast pork and illness (P < 0.01). C. perfringens type A, untypable serotype, was isolated from samples of pre-cooked vacuum sealed pork supplied by a local meat producer. Faults were noted in the food production process at the factory. Cuts of meat were too large and equipment to ensure rapid cooling of cooked meat was not installed. Cost improvements taken by hospitals, such as the use of commercially cooked meat, may not be consistent with the highest standards of food safety. Amendments to the District Catering Policy were implemented to prevent further outbreaks.",p
Trospium chloride: a quaternary amine with unique pharmacologic properties.,"The mainstay of pharmacologic treatment of overactive bladder is anticholinergic therapy. Cholinergic blockade is efficacious in decreasing the symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence, but also is associated with undesirable side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and central nervous system side effects. The property of anticholinergic agents that has been associated with increased efficacy and tolerability is receptor specificity. The safety of anticholinergic agents has been associated with the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, protein binding, and ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. Trospium chloride, available in Europe for more than 20 years and under review by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of overactive bladder, is a quaternary amine that is minimally metabolized, not highly protein-bound, and theoretically should not cross the blood brain barrier. Some of the characteristics of this unique anticholinergic agent are reviewed in this article and the relative contributions of these factors are discussed.",p
The pig as a model for the study of obesity and of control of food intake: a review.,"The use of the pig for studies of food intake and obesity is reviewed. Effects of ambient temperature and taste on food intake as well as satiety factors impicating both neural and hormonal mechanisms originating in the gastrointestinal tract are considered; the integration of information in the central nervous system for both internal and external sources is hypothesized. Special concerns of food intake controls in the neonate are discussed, including effects of neonate sweet preference on food intake, gastrointestinal satiety factors, and hypoglycemia as a stimulus for food ingestion.For obesity studies, pigs offer several advantages, including their general physiological similarity to humans, similar fat cell size, and body fat distribution. Lipogenesis, lipolysis, and lipid mobilization are under intensive study in swine and the information obtained may have important application in studies of human obesity. The voluminous literature on metabolic differences between genetically lean versus obese populations of pigs suggests possibilities for application in humans. Greater characterization of differences and similarities between pigs and humans in important metabolic parameters related to regulation of food intake and obesity should facilitate better understanding and control of human obesity.",p
Psychopathology masquerading as food allergy.,Three patients who presented with vague symptoms previously diagnosed as food allergy are reviewed. No evidence for allergy to foods was found in any of the patients. Two were depressed with psychotic thinking and the third had moderately severe anxiety with depression. All three improved following psychiatric diagnosis and intervention. One was treated with antidepressant and one with antidepressant-antipsychotic medication. All three maintained improvement two years later. The diagnosis of food allergy must be based on showing a direct relationship between the inciting food and the immunologically mediated reaction. Anxiety and depression may masquerade as food allergy. Evidence of psychopathology should be present to make such a diagnosis.,p
Determination of vitamin K in foods: a review.,"Vitamin K receives less dietary attention and fewer assays in foods than other fat-soluble vitamins. It is widely distributed in foods, usually at low concentrations. The human requirement is small. Intestinal bacteria synthesize vitamin K, which presumably helps provide the metabolic requirements for vitamin K. An RDA for vitamin K has not been published, but infants fed milk-substitute formulas risk vitamin K deficiency and it is recommended that those formulas contain supplemental vitamin K. Vitamin K in foods includes phylloquinone (K1) found in plants and several menaquinones (K2) found in animals and synthesized by microorganisms. Many vitamin K methods were developed primarily to identify forms present and determine their relative bioactivities. Until recently bioassays with chicks were the only practical methods to determine vitamin K content of foods. Various physicochemical methods have been developed to determine vitamins K in pure solutions, concentrates, and pharmaceuticals. Because of low concentrations of vitamin K in foods and the extensive purifications of extracts required, there has been only limited use of physicochemical methods, such as column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography, with foods; the latter method perhaps offers the greatest possibilities for further development.",p
Transcatheter Closure of Intracardiac Shunts.,"Intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects (ASDs), patent foramen ovales (PFOs), and ventricular septal defects (VSDs), are common forms of congenital or acquired heart disease. Traditional treatment has consisted of surgical closure. Transcatheter closure using implantable devices is now an alternative approach to the treatment of these lesions. Transcatheter closure offers advantages over surgical closure: 1) it is less invasive, resulting in shorter recovery times, less hospital time, and no scarring; 2) it avoids the deleterious neurocognitive effects of cardiopulmonary bypass; 3) it avoids the proarrhythmic effects of atrial or ventricular incisions; and 4) it is potentially less costly. Device closure of secundum ASDs is the procedure of choice. Device closure of PFOs can be performed under humanitarian device exemption (HDE) guidelines, although the indications for this procedure and its effectiveness compared with medical management remain controversial. Ongoing studies are addressing these issues. Transcatheter closure of muscular VSDs is an alternative to surgical treatment, especially for apical defects or those anterior to the moderator band. The CardioSEAL device (NMT Medical, Boston, MA) has HDE status for this purpose and the Amplatzer muscular VSD device (AGA Medical Corp., Golden Valley, MN) is being reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration for market approval. Phase 1 investigations are underway for device closure of perimembranous VSDs using the Amplatzer perimembranous VSD device (AGA Medical Corp.). Until more data are available, surgical closure of perimembranous VSDs is still the procedure of choice. Closure of postinfarct VSDs can also be accomplished using intracardiac devices; however, this remains a high-risk procedure. Early experience compares favorably with surgical closure. Transcatheter device closure of intracardiac defects is a relatively new procedure. Long-term data for these procedures are currently lacking and, therefore, recommendations regarding the use of these devices will continue to evolve with time.",p
Structure and technofunctional properties of protein-polysaccharide complexes: a review.,"Food proteins and polysaccharides are the two key structural entities in food materials. Generally, interactions between proteins and polysaccharides in aqueous media can lead to one- or two-phase systems, the latter being generally observed. In some cases of protein-polysaccharide net attraction, mainly mediated through electrostatic interactions, complex coacervation or associative phase separation occurs, giving rise to the formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes. Physicochemical factors such as pH, ionic strength, ratio of protein to polysaccharide, polysaccharide and protein charge, and molecular weight affect the formation and stability of such complexes. Additionally, the temperature and mechanical factors (pressure, shearing rate, and time) have an influence on phase separation and time stability of the system. The protein-polysaccharide complexes exhibit better functional properties than that of the proteins and polysaccharides alone. This improvement could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of the two biopolymers, as well as the structure of the complexes. Consequently, the interesting hydration (solubility, viscosity), structuration (aggregation, gelation) and surface (foaming, emulsifying) properties of these complexes can be used in a number of domains. Among others, these could be macromolecular purification, microencapsulation, food formulation (fat replacers, texturing agents), and synthesis of biomaterials (edible films, artificial grafts).",p
Mutagenic factors in cooked foods.,"The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed.",p
Factors affecting food selection: the role of economics.,"This article attempts to identify the scope and contributions of food demand research developed by microeconomists to facilitate incorporation of findings into food behavior research undertaken by nutrition professionals. It explores the ways economists have traditionally analyzed determinants of food selection, reviews the ""New Home Economics"" approach, which is being used to expand the traditional conceptual and empirical economics models, and discusses ways in which economics can contribute to a better understanding of the individual and household food selection process.",p
Prospects for chemiluminescent and bioluminescent immunoassay and nucleic acid assays in food testing and the pharmaceutical industry.,"The sensitivity, speed and convenience of chemiluminescent (CL) and bioluminescent (BL) immunoassays and probe assays have led to a diverse range of applications for these technologies, mainly in the clinical laboratory. These methods are now being explored by the food and pharmaceutical industries. Demanding detection limits and the complexity of sample preparation for food and pharmaceutical analyses present daunting challenges for the analyst. Immunoassay and nucleic acid amplification technologies have been applied to food testing, but these have mostly favoured non-luminescent endpoints. Food assays with CL or BL endpoints are now emerging, e.g., Clostridium botulinum type A detection using a CL immunosorbent assay; Salmonella and Zygosaccharomyces detection using a combination of PCR and CL detection. The analytical challenges posed by the pharmaceutical industry include testing for contaminants in raw materials and drug products, and drug discovery. The sensitivity and rapid signal acquisition characteristics of CL and BL are advantageous for the high throughput, massively parallel testing of micro-sized samples demanded in drug discovery. Current progress and the prospects for CL and BL immunoassay and nucleic acid technologies in this and other pharmaceutical and food applications is reviewed.",p
Advances in the use of stable isotopes of minerals in human studies.,"In this review, the current state of development of stable isotope methodology is discussed in relation to its application to human mineral nutrition. The minerals considered are magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, selenium, and lead. Such issues as analytical measurement methodology, the required degree of dietary enrichment, mode of isotope administration, and intrinsic labeling of human foods are reviewed and their current status is presented. It is shown that both mass spectrometry and neutron activation analysis have been applied to various aspects of this research, although the latter more widely. Research need, current problems, and the likely future direction of stable isotopes in human mineral research are summarized.",p
Occurrence and content of hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid compounds in foods.,"Phenolic acid compounds seem to be universally distributed in plants. They have been the subject of a great number of chemical, biological, agricultural, and medical studies. Hydroxycinnamic acid compounds occur most frequently as simple esters with hydroxy carboxylic acids or glucose, while the hydroxybenzoic acid compounds are present mainly in the form of glucosides. Furthermore, phenolic acids may occur in food plants as esters or glycosides conjugated with other natural compounds such as flavonoids, alcohols, hydroxyfatty acids, sterols, and glucosides. Also, hydroxycinnamic acid amides appear to be common constituents. The occurrence of the different natural phenolic acid compounds in foods is reviewed, and data of the content in fruit, vegetables, and spices are given. The distribution of the main phenolic acid compounds in food plants as well as their changes during development and maturation of fruits are considered. Furthermore, the hydroxycinnamic acids bound to cell wall polymers, the phenolic acid compounds in coffee, cereals, oil seed, and tree nuts, and the analysis of phenolic acid derivatives are reviewed.",p
Chromatographic determination of vitamins in foods.,"Chromatographic methods for the determination of water- and fat-soluble vitamins in foods are reviewed. For each vitamin, sample preparation, detection problems and chromatographic conditions are presented and discussed. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is becoming a standard method in vitamin assay, especially for routine work. HPLC systems can be automated using in-line solid-phase extraction and column switchings, resulting in very sensitive methods, even when simple UV detection is employed.",p
Food intolerance and allergy--a review.,"Specific food intolerance needs to be distinguished from obsessional states in which those who are affected have an aversion to numerous foods. Even in cases where specific food intolerance can be demonstrated, the diagnosis of food allergy depends on additional evidence that the patient's reaction is based on an abnormal immunological response. In food allergy, skin and laboratory tests may detect the presence of an IgE-mediated reaction, particularly in patients with asthma or eczema and especially where the foods involved are highly allergenic--such as egg, fish, nuts and milk. However, many patients with proven food intolerance have negative tests, suggesting that other immunological or non-immunological mechanisms are responsible. Laboratory tests for non-IgE reactions are unreliable. Where it is difficult to show a connection between individual foods and an allergic response--as in patients with urticaria provoked by food additives--one of the reasons for diagnostic difficulty is that the offending substances may be present in a wide range of common foods. If the diagnosis is to be firmly established in such cases, it is necessary to show that symptoms remit on an elimination diet and recur after a placebo-controlled challenge.",p
The potential of encapsulated iron compounds in food fortification: a review.,"Iron (Fe) encapsulation has the potential to help overcome several major challenges in Fe fortification of foods. It may decrease unwanted sensory changes in fortified products and reduce interactions of Fe with food components that lower Fe bioavailability. However, the effect of encapsulation per se on Fe bioavailability is a concern. Rat studies comparing encapsulated ferrous sulfate, ferric ammonium citrate, and ferrous fumarate to non-encapsulated compounds indicate that a ratio of capsule:substrate of > or = 60:40 may decrease the relative bioavailability (RBV) of the Fe by approximately 20%. At a ratio of capsule:substrate of < or = 50:50, the RBV of encapsulated ferrous sulfate appears to be similar to ferrous sulfate. Even minor changes in capsule composition may influence Fe bioavailability. Encapsulated ferrous fumarate given with ascorbic acid as a complementary food supplement and encapsulated ferrous sulfate fortified into salt have been shown to be efficacious in anemic children. For salt fortification, further refinements in Fe capsule design are needed to increase resistance to moisture and abrasion, while maintaining bioavailability. Studies evaluating the potential efficacy of encapsulated Fe in staple cereals (wheat and maize flours) are needed. A potential barrier to use of encapsulated forms of Fe in staple food fortification is the relatively low melting point of the capsules, which may cause unwanted sensory changes during food preparation. Research and development efforts to improve the quality of coatings and their resistance to high temperatures are ongoing. Process costs for encapsulation can be high, and unless they can be reduced, may limit applications. Further research is needed to determine which encapsulation technologies are most effective in ensuring iron bioavailability from encapsulated compounds.",p
FDA recalls: how do pacemaker manufacturers compare?,"To evaluate an apparent perception that there is no difference in reliability among the products of the major cardiac pacing system manufacturers, an extensive review of US Food and Drug Administration regulatory actions was performed. The study period was July 1974 through June 1987. The total number of affected devices was collected for each manufacturer. Available sales data were used to calculate their percentage of recalled products during two time periods. The percentage of potentially high-risk devices (Food and Drug Administration class I and II recalls) was high for one company, moderate for one, and relatively low for the rest. Potential biases in some other sources of reliability information, as well as implications for regulatory policies, are discussed. The data reported establish that there have been past deficiencies in recall management. Although further pacing device recalls are probable, appropriate early regulatory and manufacturer action should help to assure that both the immense cost and patient distress caused by pacer and related product problems in the past can be minimized in the future.",p
"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly Features: A Meta-analysis on User Review
  About Food Journaling Apps","  Users review about an app is a crucial component for open mobile application
market, such as the AppStore and the Google play. Analyzing these reviews can
reveal user's sentiment towards a feature in the app. There exist several
analytical tools to summarize user reviews and extract meaningful sense out of
them. However, these tools are still limited in terms of expressiveness and
accurately classifying the reviews into more than a positive and a negative
review. There is a need to get more insights from user app reviews and direct
it to future app development. In this paper, we present our result of analyzing
user reviews of 20 food journaling and health tracking apps. We gathered and
analyzed reviews per app and classified them into three distinct categories
using the sentiment treebank with recursive neural tensor network. We then
analyzed the vocabulary frequency per category using the Gensim implementation
of Word2Vec model. The analysis result clustered the reviews into good, bad and

We identified major reasons why users express a certain sentiment towards an
app and learned how users' satisfaction or complaints was related to a specific
feature. This research could be a guideline for app developers to follow when
developing an app to refrain from adopting techniques that might demotivate

Diet and the prevention of childhood allergic disease.,"Childhood allergic disease is common and is becoming more so. The relationship between such disease and infant feeding and early exposure to food antigens is reviewed. The studies appearing to confirm and refute the theory that breast feeding prevents allergic disease are critically surveyed and it is concluded that the best studies strongly support the view that breast feeding is beneficial. The notion that feeding a soya formula is protective is reviewed and little evidence is found to uphold this claim. Caution is urged concerning the feeding of goat's milk to infants as it has not been shown to prevent allergy, is nutritionally inadequate, and potentially hazardous. The evidence that food antigens cross the placenta and enter breast milk and can then sensitize the baby is analysed and the studies concerning the role of weaning diet in the development of allergic disease are reviewed. It is concluded that, especially for the genetically-at-risk infant, prolonged breast feeding and selective weaning does decrease the risk of allergic disease, whereas feeding a soya formula does not, and that it is not yet known if maternal exclusion of certain foods in pregnancy and lactation is beneficial.",p
Future directions in food composition studies.,"Food composition studies are essential for many purposes in nutrition, food science, and dietetics. This article reviews uses of food composition information in food labeling, nutrition education, dietary surveys, epidemiological studies, and dietary intervention trials. Research is need to minimize the causes of variation between actual and measured diets. This involves minimizing errors in food sampling, chemical analysis, food composition table construction, nutrient data bases for food groups, and in computations using nutrient analysis systems. Critical knowledge relative to food composition necessary for food science experts, nutrition professionals and other professionals is discussed. Improving the reporting of food composition data will also require more attention by editors of journals: if they demand more documentation, they will get it.",p
"Salmonellae, salmonellosis, and dairy foods: a review.","Salmonellae continue to be a major concern for the dairy industry because these bacteria have caused recent outbreaks of illness and have been isolated from various dairy products in the market place. Salmonellae are generally not heat resistant and normally grow at 35 to 37 degrees C, but they can grow at much lower temperatures, provided that the incubation time is suitably extended. To minimize problems, foods should be held at or below 2 to 5 degrees C at all times. Both conventional and rapid methods are available to isolate salmonellae from dairy foods and to identify the bacteria. Salmonellae behave differently in different kinds of cheese: they survived in ripening Cheddar cheese for up to 7 mo at 13 degrees C and for 10 mo at 7 degrees C; in coldpack cheese food for several weeks, depending on the pH and preservative used; and in Domiati cheese 13 to 36 d, depending on the manufacturing process used. When Mozzarella cheese was made, temperatures of stretching and molding (60 degrees C) killed all salmonellae present, but, in cottage cheese, survival of the pathogen depended on the cooking temperature of curd. Spray drying of skim milk killed substantial numbers of salmonellae, but some survivors remained. Butter readily supported growth of salmonellae at room temperature, and neither freezing nor refrigeration for brief periods eliminated salmonellae from butter. Use of appropriate hygienic procedures, e.g., Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system, during processing should reduce the likelihood of salmonellosis outbreaks associated with dairy foods.",p
Lectins in the United States diet: a survey of lectins in commonly consumed foods and a review of the literature.,"Plant lectins or phytohemagglutinins possess potent in vivo biological activities. Some, primarily of the family Leguminosae, have been shown to have deleterious nutritional effects. Little information exists, however, regarding the prevalence of lectins or the specific foods that contain lectins in the United States diet. In the present study the edible parts of 29 of 88 foods tested, including common salad ingredients, fresh fruits, roasted nuts, and processed cereals were found to possess significant lectin-like activity as assessed by hemagglutination and bacterial agglutination assays. Based on this survey and a review of the literature we conclude that dietary exposure to plant lectins is widespread. The spectrum of nutritional consequences of such exposure remains to be determined.",p
New pharmacologic agents in the treatment of asthma.,"This article will review four new medications for the treatment of asthma. Extensive studies have been undertaken with these medications to demonstrate their efficacy. All these agents, in use in other countries, are presently in different stages of review by the Food and Drug Administration. This review will give physicians an understanding of these medications, so when they are approved in the United States, the clinician will have an idea of their proper place in treatment of the asthmatic patient.",p
Guidance values for microcystins in water and cyanobacterial supplement products (blue-green algal supplements): a reasonable or misguided approach?,"This article reviews current scientific knowledge on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of microcystins and compares this to the guidance values proposed for microcystins in water by the World Health Organization, and for blue-green algal food supplements by the Oregon State Department of Health. The basis of the risk assessment underlying these guidance values is viewed as being critical due to overt deficiencies in the data used for its generation: (i) use of one microcystin congener only (microcystin-LR), while the other presently known nearly 80 congeners are largely disregarded, (ii) new knowledge regarding potential neuro and renal toxicity of microcystins in humans and (iii) the inadequacies of assessing realistic microcystin exposures in humans and especially in children via blue-green algal food supplements. In reiterating the state-of-the-art toxicology database on microcystins and in the light of new data on the high degree of toxin contamination of algal food supplements, this review clearly demonstrates the need for improved kinetic data of microcystins in humans and for discussion concerning uncertainty factors, which may result in a lowering of the present guidance values and an increased routine control of water bodies and food supplements for toxin contamination. Similar to the approach taken previously by authorities for dioxin or PCB risk assessment, the use of a toxin equivalent approach to the risk assessment of microcystins is proposed.",p
A survey of food recommenders,"  Everyone eats. However, people do not always know what to eat. They need a
little help and inspiration. Consequently, a number of apps, services, and
programs have developed recommenders around food. These cover food, meal,
recipe, and restaurant recommendations, which are the most common use cases,
but also other areas such as substitute ingredients, menus, and diets. The
latter is especially important in the area of health and wellness where users
have more specific dietary needs and goals.
  In this survey, we review the food recommender literature. We cover the types
of systems in terms of their goals and what they are recommending, the datasets
and signals that they use to train models, the technical approaches and model
types used, as well as some of the system constraints.

Iron fortification: an update.,"Iron fortification is the optimal approach to reducing the high prevalence of iron deficiency in developing countries. Selection of the iron source entails a compromise between the use of inert compounds which are poorly absorbed and chemically reactive forms with high bioavailability. Although the vehicle and fortification compound must be chosen in tandem because most iron compounds cause discoloration or rancidity, the emphasis in this review is on the food vehicle. Technology for fortifying wheat flour and bread is well established and the use of these vehicles has probably had a significant impact on iron status in Western countries. Recent studies in India indicate that the fortification of common salt is technically feasible and field trials have shown a good hematological response. Similar success has been achieved by fortifying refined sugar with NaFeEDTA in Guatemala. Rice has advantages as a vehicle in those areas where it is the staple food but the technology requires further development. Fish-based condiments have been successfully fortified with NaFeEDTA and show promise as a vehicle in East Asian countries. The fortification of infant foods poses no technical problems and should be encouraged. Additional work is needed to identify other fortification options and to develop targeted fortification programs that will direct iron to those segments of a population in greatest need.",p
Effects of cooking and storage methods on the micronutrient content of foods.,"Food processing has the potential to alter the nutrient quality of foods. This review deals with the effects of home-based cooking and storage practices on the micronutrient content of foods. It describes the effects of cooking, freezing and refrigeration on the vitamin and mineral content of meats, fish, fruit, vegetables and cereals. Based on this review, we suggest that the consumer should be aware of the possibility that losses in nutritional quality of foods may result from an improper use of cooking and storage techniques available at home.",p
Approaches in the safety evaluations of veterinary antimicrobial agents in food to determine the effects on the human intestinal microflora.,"The administration of antimicrobial agents to livestock creates potential for antibiotic residues to enter the food supply and be consumed by humans. Therefore, as a process of food animal drug registration, national regulatory agencies and international committees evaluate data regarding the chemical, microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pharmacologic, toxicologic, and antimicrobial properties of veterinary drugs to assess the safety of ingested antimicrobial residues to consumers. Currently, European, Australian and United States guidelines for veterinary drug registration require a safety assessment of microbiologic hazards from consumption of antimicrobial residues taking into account the potentially adverse effects on human intestinal microflora. The main concerns addressed are selection of resistant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and disruption of the colonization barrier of the resident intestinal microflora. Current requirements differ among national agencies. Efforts are ongoing internationally to review and harmonize approaches and test methods and protocols for application to these microbiologic safety evaluations of antimicrobial drug residues in food. This review describes the background to current regulatory approaches used in applying in vitro and in vivo methods to set a microbiologic acceptable daily intake for residues in food derived from animals treated with an antimicrobial agent. This paper also examines the current research needs to support these evaluations.",p
IgE-mediated food allergy--extensive review of the literature.,"Adverse reactions to food, i.e. food allergy and intolerance have gained considerable attention. This overview focuses on the diagnosis and management of IgE-mediated food allergy that is believed to be responsible for most immediate-type food-induced hypersensitivity reactions. Clinically, these reactions are characterised by a variety of signs and symptoms that occur within minutes or hours after consumption of the offending food. Reactions may be limited or more generalised with involvement of the skin, nose, eyes, and/or lungs. In more severe cases, cardiovascular symptoms including hypotension, shock, cardiac dysrhythmias and death can occur. In food-allergic individuals, IgE is produced against naturally occurring food components, primarily glycoproteins that usually retain their allergenicity after heating and/or proteolysis. While adults tend to be allergic to fish, crustaceans, peanuts and tree nuts, children tend to be allergic to cow's milk, egg white, wheat and soy more frequently. ""Emerging"" food allergens include tropical fruits, sesame seeds, psyllium, spices and condiments. These allergies frequently represent a cross-allergy to an allergen derived from another source, e.g. pollens or natural rubber latex. The evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy relies on a careful history, physical examination, appropriate skin testing or in vitro testing with food extracts, and/or double blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. Avoidance remains the mainstay of therapy. However, allergens may be ""hidden"" and labelling can be non-precise or misleading, thereby severely hampering prevention. Patients with severe allergies should keep at hand an emergency kit with adrenaline, an antihistamine and an injectable rapid onset-of-action corticosteroid. At present there is no evidence to support the use of immunotherapy, except for research purposes. Production of ""hypoallergenic"" food is hampered by incomplete methods for assessing the allergenic potential of such novel foods.",p
Role of probiotics in the management of patients with food allergy.,"OBJECTIVE
This review will concentrate on the potential use of probiotics in treating or preventing allergic disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract. In small infants, most reactions to foods are manifested in the gastro-intestinal tract. As children get older, cutaneous and even systemic or respiratory manifestations of food intolerances may be more common. In most instances, allergic disorders in the gut cause inflammation in the mucosa.


DATA SOURCES
Recently, the role of gut microflora in allergic disease has gained increasing interest with reports of probiotics being used to treat food allergy.


STUDY SELECTION
Pertinent scientific reports on the role of probiotics in the management of patients with food allergy will be reviewed. A recent study to determine the effect of very early probiotic colonization will be extensively reviewed as it presents an intriguing concept of a preventive strategy related to food allergy development


RESULTS
Significant improvement has been noted in infants receiving Lactobacillus GG in their extensively hydrolyzed formula.


CONCLUSIONS
It is likely more studies will be forthcoming with different probiotic organisms in the prevention and treatment of allergic disorders in children and adults.",p
Some interrelated thermophysical properties of liquid water and ice. I. A user-friendly modeling review for food high-pressure processing.,"A bibliographic search yielded a set of empirical equations that constitute an easy method for the calculation of some thermophysical properties of both liquid water and ice I, properties that are involved in the modeling of thermal processes in the high-pressure domain, as required in the design of new high-pressure food processes. These properties, closely interrelated in their physical derivation and experimental measurement, are specific volume, specific isobaric heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, and isothermal compressibility coefficient. Where no single equation was found, an alternative method for calculation is proposed. Keeping in mind the intended applications and considering the availability of both experimental data and empirical equations, the limits for the set of equations where set in -40 to 120 degrees C and 0 to 500 MPa for liquid water and -30 to 0 degrees C and 0 to 210 MPa for ice I. The equations and methods selected for each property are described and their results analyzed. Their good agreement with many existing experimental data is discussed. In addition, the routines implemented for the calculation of these properties after the described equations are made available in the public domain.",p
Dietary intake and sources of isoflavones among Japanese.,"We examined the dietary intake and sources of isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) among Japanese subjects based on dietary records (DRs). The subjects comprised two groups: 1,232 who completed one-day DRs (Group 1) and 88 men and women who kept four four-day (16-day) DRs. For quantitative data on the level of daidzein and genistein in soy foods, we extensively reviewed the literature, particularly for Japanese soy foods, and adopted the median value for each food. The median intake of daidzein was 12.1 and 9.5 mg/day among Groups 1 and 2, respectively, while the corresponding values for genistein were 19.6 and 14.9 mg/day. The top four foods (tofu, miso, natto, and fried tofu) covered about 90% of the population intake of daidzein and genistein. It did not seem feasible to estimate one's intake of isoflavones by using dietary recording/recall in epidemiological studies, since the day-to-day variation in intake was too large, the within-person coefficient of variation being 89.1% for daidzein and genistein. Therefore, we should use other methods, such as food-frequency questionnaires, focusing on the four major sources of isoflavones, to assess individual isoflavone intake.",p
How much food is too much? Threshold doses for allergenic foods.,"This review summarizes recent findings and controversies in the area of threshold doses for allergenic foods. Over the years, there have been many clinical reports that ingestion of small amounts of food can elicit IgE-mediated allergic reactions. In exquisitely allergic individuals, the threshold dose for elicitation of such reactions is often considered to be zero. However, some food-allergic patients report that they can tolerate small quantities of allergenic food. Are very low quantities hazardous to food-allergic consumers? How much of the offending food is too much? Why is the concept of a threshold level important? There have been very few studies to date on threshold doses for allergenic foods, and more research is needed in this important area.",p
Nutrition information sources.,"Medical personnel and medical librarians may tend to think of nutrition in medical terms and to forget its interdisciplinary aspects. For this reason, it is desirable for medical librarians to become familiar with a variety of sources of information on the composition of foods, nutrient values, food additives, and food protection. Many of these are government publications from such agencies as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Research Council, and the Food and Agriculture Organization. Less familiar sources include nutrition materials from state agricultural experiment stations and extension services and important data published in a wide range of scientific or agricultural journals, which may be located through Nutrition Abstracts and Reviews, Food Science and Technology Abstracts, and the Bibliography of Agriculture. Sources of current information on nutrition research in progress include the Department of Agriculture's Current Research Information System (CRIS) and selective listings from the Smith-sonian Information Exchange.",p
Iron sources used in food fortification and their changes due to food processing.,"The effect of food processing on the biological availability of iron in iron-fortified foods is critically reviewed. Studies on changes in the chemistry of the iron in processed foods are examined. Various iron sources currently used in food fortification in the U.S. are defined with emphasis on their biological availabilities under various conditions. The availability of iron in foods depends upon numerous factors, most of which are not fully understood. A factor which is often overlooked is the interaction of the iron with the food during events such as cooking or processing. Chemical changes in the iron compounds occur which may correlate with changes in the biological availability.",p
Determination of vitamin A in foods--a review.,"Formerly, few foods were routinely analyzed for vitamin A, but recent emphasis on nutrient requirements, nutrient labeling, and use of dietary convenience foods has created need for determining vitamin A in a variety of foods. There are many vitamin A methods--some suitable for certain products only. For regulatory purposes, the FDA specifies the AOAC method where it is applicable. However, some food analysts and organizations continue with their own vitamin A methods. If possible, a single, widely applicable general method should be used for vitamin A in foods. Vitamin A may be determined by spectrophotometric, colorimetric, and fluorometric procedures. Sometimes chromatography is required as an important part of the method. Colorimetric procedures with SbCl3 are now most widely used to measure vitamin A (retinol) in foods. If vitamin A content is high enough and extracts sufficiently free of interfering substances, spectrophotometric or flurometric methods are satisfactory. Methods in various stages of development for determining vitamin A in foods are based on flurospectrophotometry, gas-liquid chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and automation. To estimate total vitamin A nutritional value of certain foods may also require determination of vitamin A isomerization and contents of carotenes, cryptoxanthin, reinaldehyde, and apo-carotenal.",p
Yersinia enterocolitica : a review of its role in food hygiene.,"Since Yersinia enterocolitica, now classified as a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, was recognized as a distinct species in 1964 it has been isolated with increasing frequency from man and animals (including dogs and pigs) and from some human foods. Y. enterocolitica infections are now seen as a cause for some concern in both human and veterinary medicine. The organism is commonly found in specimens from swine slaughterhouses and has been isolated from samples of market meat, vacuum-packed beef, mussels, oysters, and ice-cream. It has also been found in nonchlorinated well water used for drinking purposes. Infections in man therefore probably have an alimentary origin. Only 23 human infections were recorded in 1966 but the number increased to over 4000 in 1974. However, reported incidence is affected by growing awareness about the role of the organism in human and animal disease and by intensive laboratory analyses. While knowledge about the geographical distribution of Y. enterocolitica is still fragmentary it is clear that infections are very frequent in some parts of the world and probably common but unrecognized in many countries. The most common symptoms of Y. enterocolitica infections in man are fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. In the USA most isolations in human infections were made from blood and mesenteric lymph node samples. The pathogenic mechanism is not known. In one experiment involving a human volunteer subject a dose of 3.5 x 10(9) organisms was required to produce an infection. Only recently has some success been obtained in establishing experimental infections in mice, guinea-pigs, rats, and rabbits. Laboratory cultivation techniques for Y. enterocolitica are described together with a table of minimal tests for characterizing the organism and two biotyping schema. Little is known about methods for controlling this disease, but environmental hygiene and sanitation with regard to food and water should apply.",p
Food contamination by metals and pesticides in the European Union. Should we worry?,"The estimation of the risk associated with dietary intakes of heavy metals and pesticide residues by the consumer is a vital and integral part of regulatory processes. The exposure of the consumer is compared directly to the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for pesticides and to the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for heavy metals. The exposure is obtained using the basic equation: Exposure (mg/kg b.w./day)=Consumption (mg/kg b.w./day) x Residue (mg/kg). The establishment of the ADI and the TDI is based on the results of toxicological studies that involve the determination of the lowest-no-observed-adverse-effect level/10 (SF1) x10 (SF2), where SF corresponds to 'Safety Factor'. SF1 and SF2 account for interspecies and intraspecies variability, respectively. In order to evaluate the risk for the consumer, that is associated to the presence of heavy metals and pesticides in food, a review of the level of contamination in European countries has been made. The exposure of European consumers to lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury is superior to the TDI. For pesticides, the first step is to compare the detected amount of residues of a specific pesticide to the maximum residue level (MRL) authorized in foodstuffs. If the residue level in food exceeds the MRL, the theoretical maximum daily intakes and the ADI have to be taken into account in order to assess the risk for the consumer.",p
"Evaluation of health aspects of sugars contained in carbohydrate sweeteners. Report of Sugars Task Force, 1986.","A critical review composed of two parts: estimates of present levels of sugars intake and of recent trends in nutritive carbohydrate sweetener content of the food supply and a review of recent scientific literature addressing potentially adverse health effects associated with sugars consumption.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s impact on laboratory performance: FDA's perspective.,"The Division of Clinical Laboratory Devices is responsible for the premarket review of in vitro diagnostic devices (laboratory tests). We currently process >1000 diverse applications per year. New versions of old devices are handled as premarket notifications, so-called 510(k) submissions. The review objective is to establish that the new product is ""substantially equivalent"" to its predicate. Fundamentally new devices are handled as premarket applications. The review objective is to establish de novo that the product is ¿safe and effective.¿ A central regulatory issue over the past several years has been the development of a standardized model for scientific review. The Food and Drug Administration contributes to the quality of in vitro diagnostic devices by providing oversight and objective review, by setting thresholds for product safety and effectiveness, and by ensuring that organized data and appropriate labeling is present in support of a device's intended use.",p
Food safety: action to protect the consumer.,"Food safety issues have been headline news frequently in recent years. A review of food legislation was started in 1984 and led to the Food Safety Act 1990. This Act, which may prove to be the last major piece of independent British food law, provides food authorities with new powers to prevent the distribution of contaminated food and ensure that proper practices are being carried out by food businesses, and establishes a registration system for food businesses. Other developments include a new system for the inspection of food premises and plans to introduce a requirement for hygiene training for food handlers. The process of European harmonisation will require a further series of changes--forthcoming proposals provide for quality standards for laboratories, and more frequent inspection requirements covering a wide range of products.",p
Food safety for the 1990s.,"The epidemiology of foodborne disease has evolved as a result of changes in the types and sources of food consumed, new methods of food production, the emergence of new infectious agents, and new trends involving known infectious agents. The results of foodborne disease surveillance at the Minnesota Department of Health demonstrate the importance of these factors and suggest that foodborne disease problems are actually much more widespread than previously acknowledged. The public health agenda for the 1990s must include a comprehensive review of food safety.",p
"Review of trends in food use in the United States, 1909 to 1980.","A review of per capita food use in this country between 1909 and 1980 indicates increased use of some food groups--meat, poultry, and fish; dairy products; fats and oils; fruits; vegetables; and sugars and other sweeteners--and decreased use of eggs, potatoes, and grain products. Use of foods in other groups--dry beans, peas, nuts, and soy products and the miscellaneous group which includes coffee, tea, and chocolate products--remained relatively low and stable. Changes in the use of foods are reflected in the nutrient levels of the food supply. The food energy level was slightly higher in 1980 than in 1909-13, but the proportion of energy from fat increased from 32 to 42 percent; the proportion from carbohydrate decreased from 56 to 46 percent; the proportion from protein remained about 12 percent. Between 1909-13 and 1980, large increases occurred in the levels of niacin, thiamin, and riboflavin in the food supply. Smaller increases occurred for ascorbic acid, iron, vitamin B12, calcium, and vitamin A. The levels of phosphorus and zinc were almost unchanged, while the levels of vitamin B6 and magnesium decreased.",p
Dual role of organosulfur compounds in foods: a review.,"Organosulfur compounds present in natural food are generally considered as beneficial for health because of their antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties. This has led to their excessive and long-term consumption. However, there is also evidence that these compounds demonstrate toxicity and adverse health effects suggesting their potential dual biological roles. Thus, they can act as double-edged biological swords.",p
Weight loss in Alzheimer's disease: an international review of the literature.,"Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 2 million elderly in the U.S. and challenges primary care physicians to assist caregivers in dealing with the daily management of these patients. To support the clinical observation of weight loss in Alzheimer patients despite adequate food intake, we reviewed the existing literature. To date, eight international studies have focused on nutrition in Alzheimer's disease and all have found weight loss. It is not clear whether this weight loss is a component of or a consequence of the disease. These findings suggest systemic, metabolic alterations in Alzheimer's disease. They require further investigation as to their nature and as to their appropriate recognition and management to retard the deteriorating effects of chronic weight loss and malnutrition. Finally, some reports lead to speculation that nutritional strategies may improve cognitive function.",p
Topological structure and interaction strengths in model food webs,"  We report the results of carrying out a large number of simulations on a
coevolutionary model of multispecies communities. A wide range of parameter
values were investigated which allowed a rather complete picture of the change
in behaviour of the model as these parameters were varied to be built up. Our
main interest was in the nature of the community food webs constructed via the
simulations. We identify the range of parameter values which give rise to
realistic food webs and give arguments which allow some of the structure which
is found to be understood in an intuitive way. Since the webs are evolved
according to the rules of the model, the strengths of the predator-prey links
are not determined a priori, and emerge from the process of constructing the
web. We measure the distribution of these link strengths, and find that there
are a large number of weak links, in agreement with recent suggestions. We also
review some of the data on food webs available in the literature, and make some
tentative comparisons with our results. The difficulties of making such
comparisons and the possible future developments of the model are also briefly
discussed.

FDA labeling system for drugs in pregnancy.,"OBJECTIVE
To review the current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy labeling system, examine the new FDA-proposed pregnancy labeling system for form and content, and provide comments on its suitability for implementation.


DATA SOURCES
Data were obtained from the FDA's Web site (www.fda.gov), PubMed, Federal Register, LexisNexis, Physician's Desk Reference (PDR), Drugdex, and Current Contents.


STUDY SELECTION
Research and articles involving drugs and pregnancy, drugs and lactation, and the subcommittee meeting of the FDA were included.


DATA EXTRACTION
Prospective, case-control studies from pregnancy registries.


DATA SYNTHESIS
Currently, only 40% of drugs in the PDR have pregnancy categories listed. The medical profession has resorted to other means to assess pregnancy risk, such as retrospective chart review, case reports, and consultation with experts such as regional drug information centers.


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed pregnancy labeling system strives for more clinical usefulness by reliance on human data derived from pregnancy registries. The clinical usefulness of the new labeling remains to be seen.",p
Subchronic toxicity study in rats and genotoxicity tests with polyvinyl alcohol.,"The potential systemic and neurotoxicity of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was assessed when fed in the diet to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats for 90 days at doses of 2000, 3500 and 5000 mg/kg/day. Control rats received untreated standard laboratory diet. Assessments included clinical observations, ophthalmology, body weight and food consumption, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalyses, motor activity and functional observational battery evaluations and gross and microscopic pathology. The only test-article-related finding observed during the study was unformed stool with brown/black anogenital staining in rats fed 3500 and 5000 mg/kg/day. This finding was attributed to the high levels of test article being consumed and subsequently excreted in the stool. It was not accompanied by macroscopic or microscopic changes in these rats. No test-article-related changes were seen in mortality, ophthalmology, body weight and food consumption data, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis data, functional observational assessments, motor activity, organ weight data and macroscopic and microscopic examinations. Doses of 2000, 3500 and 5000 mg/kg/day of PVA administered as a dietary admixture to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats for up to 90 days did not result in any adverse, toxicological effects. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be 5000 mg/kg/day. PVA showed no evidence of mutagenic activity in the Ames test, mouse lymphoma assay and the mouse micronucleus test. (A critical evaluation of the available information on PVA will appear in a review to be published in Food and Chemical Toxicology 2003, 41, 319-326)",p
Toxicology then and now.,"A review of the history of the evolution of the science of toxicology from the original concepts of Paracelsus through the early development of analytical chemistry and its contributions to the detection of toxic substances in foods and drugs as these have led to modern regulatory rules for public protection is presented. The legal actions taken to protect against adulteration of food prior to the early steps by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that concluded with the passage of the 1906 Food and Drug Act are systematically documented. The history is reviewed of the Food and Drug Administration's role in the use of animal toxicity studies to develop reasonable criteria for safety of foods and drugs for man. Modern concepts of molecular distribution, metabolism, and excretion of substances in the animal body are discussed as these impinge on the so-called ""protection index."" The legal and often litigious controversies over the claimed carcinogenicity of chemical substances is documented with comments on the Delaney dilemma and the role of in vitro tests in toxicology. The review concludes with a discussion of the hazards of use of stochastic mathematical models to assess carcinogenicity and suggests that the criteria employed in the report of the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Council are properly structured to give a contemporary evaluation of all the currently available data. References give documentation of events over the past 200 years that explain the present state of toxicology as a discipline.",p
Attitudes and food habits--a review.,"The inadequacy of a definition of attitudinal terms has complicated the interpretation of many food habit studies. This review has focused on the multidimensional character of the word ""attitude"" as an aid to gaining insight into food habit development and change. The five definitional categories presented (attitudes as preferences, as overt food behavior, as willingness or ability to change, as agreement among family members, and as complexity of meanings) do not preclude other definitions. Knowledge of attitude studies can foster understanding of the link between nutritional knowledge and actual behavior, as well as help practitioners to be more effective in formulating objectives and developing techniques for nutrition education. The various dimensions and meanings of attitudes indicate the need for continued research to clarify the effect of well defined attitude variables on food habits.",p
The Fifth World Food Survey: an assessment of food supplies and malnutrition.,"The methodology and findings of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Fifth World Food Survey are reviewed. Data compiled from national food balance sheets indicate that per capita energy supplies increased by 14% during the past two decades. The number of undernourished is estimated for the periods 1969 to 1971 and 1979 to 1981 on the basis of a distribution of population food intakes and two alternative estimates of minimal energy requirements. The survey findings indicate that the proportion of undernourished in the developing market economies decreased, although an estimated 335 million to 494 million people fall in this category. In the least developed countries, the proportion of undernourished increased during this period. Elimination of poverty, the fundamental cause of malnutrition, through increased economic and agricultural development, is regarded as the only long-term solution to malnutrition. Short-term solutions are also needed to address interim needs and the diverse environmental, social, and cultural factors implicated in the causation of malnutrition. Short-term solutions include nutrition programs, complementary health measures, food subsidies, population programs, and programs aimed at improving the status of women. Projected future food needs in developing countries also indicate the need for increased international food trade and expanded foreign aid.",p
Food-borne nitrates and nitrites as a cause of methemoglobinemia.,"Methemoglobinemia is a potentially fatal condition. Previous reports of toxic methemoglobinemia due to food-borne nitrates and nitrites are reviewed. Contamination of food during manufacture or degradation of nitrates in vegetables appear to be the most important factors. Some food items, such as refrigerated ""dim-sum"", stuffed pork and Chinese sausages, are very popular among some Asian populations; a stringent control against the excessive use of nitrates and nitrites is required in order to prevent outbreaks of toxic methemoglobinemia. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, a common condition in some Asian populations, may present with methemoglobinemia and intravascular hemolysis following exposure to oxidant drugs or chemicals. Methylene blue is inefficient and may exacerbate hemolysis in these patients; partial exchange transfusion may be required.",p
Food intolerance and food allergy in children: a review of 68 cases.,"The clinical and laboratory features of 68 children with food intolerance or food allergy are reviewed. Young children were affected the most with 79% first experiencing symptoms before age 1 year. Forty-eight (70%) children presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhoea, colic, abdominal pain, failure to thrive), 16 (24%) children with skin manifestations (eczema, urticaria, angioneurotic oedema, other rashes), and 4 (6%) children with wheeze. Twenty-one children had failed to thrive before diagnosis. A single food (most commonly cows' milk) was concerned in 28 (41%) cases. Forty (59%) children had multiple food intolerance or allergy; eggs, cows' milk, and wheat were the most common. Diagnosis was based on observing the effect of food withdrawal and of subsequent rechallenge. In many children food withdrawal will mean the use of an elimination diet which requires careful supervision by a dietician. Laboratory investigations were often unhelpful in suggesting or confirming the diagnosis.",p
Children's food patterns--a review: I. Food preferences and feeding problems.,"Many studies of children's food preferences and feeding problems are limited by cultural definition of food preferences, feeding problems, and parental management (32, 40, 51, 59, 90). In general, most samples have been white middle class families with children in nursery school; nutritional adequacy has not been considered; food preferences and feeding problems have not been well defined; and poorly documented observations have been generalized to other or all populations. The results at this level of abstraction do not offer solutions to children's food behavior or begin to unravel the mystery of the role of preferences and problems in predicting food behavior and nutritional status. Although results of studies may vary because of methodology, the greatest problem is the level of abstraction. Some research is beginning to identify more rigorously attributes, dimensions, or factors involved in the formation of children's food patterns, using a broader theoretical framework (29, 33, 34, 47, 63, 64, 66, 68-70). Part II of this article examines food preferences by using a family point of view.",p

Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry in food analysis.,"This work provides an updated overview (including works published till June 2004) on the principal applications of capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) together with their main advantages and drawbacks in food science. Thus, analysis of amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, or polyphenols by CE-MS in different foods is reviewed. Also, other natural compounds (e.g., alkaloids) and toxins analyzed by CE-MS in foods are revised. Moreover, exogenous substances with a potential risk for human health (e.g., pesticides, drugs) detected in foods by CE-MS are included in this work. The usefulness of CE-MS for food analysis and the information that this coupling can provide in terms of processing, composition, authenticity, quality, or safety of foods is also discussed.",p
Essential oil mouthwashes: a key component in oral health management.,"This Supplement provides clear evidence that essential oil (EO) mouthwashes can be a beneficial, safe component of daily oral health routines. However, despite the wealth of supporting evidence, several issues are worthy of discussion. Patient compliance is a clear issue with oral home-care routines, and the emphasis is on dental professionals to communicate the importance of adherence. The reasons for each step of the oral-care routine (i.e. brushing, flossing, rinsing) should be clearly explained, and if required, additional motivation should be provided. Most mouthwashes contain denatured alcohol as a delivery vehicle, and some concern has been raised about the association of alcohol with oral cancer. However, a review by the Food and Drug Administration and American Dental Association found that the supporting evidence to date is inconsistent and contradictory. Some mouthwashes have a pH below 5.5, and some researchers believe that this can lead to tooth erosion. Studies have shown that although the pH of an EO mouthwash is below 5.5, salivary pH remains above 5.5 following rinsing and for 15 min postrinse.",p
A nursing home outbreak of Clostridium perfringens associated with pureed food.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate and ascertain the source of a nursing home outbreak of gastroenteritis in Melbourne in 1997.


METHOD
A retrospective cohort study. We obtained fecal and food samples and environmental swabs, and reviewed food handling.


RESULTS
There were 25 cases, and 21 of these had their meals pureed (liquidised). The relative risk for eating pureed food and becoming ill was 5.8 (95% CI 2.2-15.4). Clostridium perfringens and its enterotoxin was detected in nine fecal samples. Samples of pureed food tested positive for coliforms.


CONCLUSIONS
This outbreak was caused by C. perfringens contaminating pureed food. Food liquidising provides opportunities for re-contamination of cooked food through the use of contaminated equipment and deficiencies in food handling practices. Pureed foods should be reheated to 70 degrees C after liquidising to inactivate pathogens.


IMPLICATIONS
Health care facilities need to take specific precautions to manage the special hazards involved in preparing pureed food.",p
The food additive-free diet in the treatment of behavior disorders: a review.,"A food additive-free diet has been recommended as a component of the treatment of developmental/behavioral disorders in children. This diet was initially developed by Dr. Benjamin Feingold for the treatment of aspirin sensitivity in adults, and then extended by him to the management, particularly, of hyperactivity and learning disability in children. The rationale for this diet and the methods employed in investigating its use are described. The claimed therapeutic effects of this diet have been investigated in a number of well-designed studies reviewed here. These studies generally refute a causal association between food additives and behavioral disturbance in children. Suggestions are made regarding the approach towards food additive-free diet therapy in the management of developmental/behavioral disorders.",p
Physiological control of energy balance.,"Physiological control of energy balance is reviewed in terms of food seeking and enery (food) intake, utilization and storage. In particular the role of hormonal and metabolic signals, as clarified by whole-body calorimetry and cellular studies, and the interaction of energy expenditure with the mechanism regulating intake are outlined.",p
Food hypersensitivity and allergic disease: a selective review.,"Food intolerance can be caused by immunologic, pharmacologic, toxic, infectious, idiosyncratic, metabolic, and neuropsychologic processes. Food allergy denotes an adverse reaction to food or food additives in which an underlying immunologic mechanism can be shown. Its incidence in young children is approximately 1.3% and among adults is 0.3%. Parental history of atopy is a significant causal factor. In addition, exposure to common allergenic foods in infancy increases risk. For these reasons, exclusive breast-feeding and maternal avoidance of peanut, egg, fish, and dairy products during lactation has been recommended and shown to reduce the occurrence of food allergy. Wheat, egg, and fish should not be introduced until the infant is aged > 12 mo and peanut until the age of 36 mo. These measures and other environmental precautions can be expected to reduce the cumulative prevalence of allergy.",p
The role of heightened surveillance in an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157.H7.,"After instituting laboratory screening for Escherichia coli O157.H7, a Connecticut hospital isolated the organism from four persons in September 1993. As a result, an outbreak of E. coli O157.H7 associated with a country club was detected. The club had served hamburger from the same shipment at two picnics. Attendees of two picnics were interviewed, stool cultures were obtained from symptomatic persons, and the remaining hamburger was cultured. Twenty (22%) of 89 persons who ate hamburger became ill, compared with 1 of 60 who did not eat hamburger (relative risk = 13.5, 95% confidence interval 3.2-56.3). Among persons who ate hamburgers, illness was strongly associated with eating hamburger that was not thoroughly cooked (P < 0.001). All 20 samples from 5 remaining boxes of patties yielded E. coli O157.H7. Isolates from hamburger and case-patients were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Heightened surveillance can rapidly identify outbreaks and may mitigate their impact. However, continued review of food safety issues is necessary if E. coli O157.H7 outbreaks are to be prevented.",p
Relevance of carcass palpation in lambs to protecting public health.,"We recently reviewed the Food Safety and Inspection Service's (FSIS's) inspection procedures for lambs. As a result, FSIS published a Federal Register notice informing the public of its intent to change from an inspection system that requires extensive carcass palpation to an inspection system that requires no carcass palpation for lambs. This decision was based on the following three points. (i) Extensive carcass palpation in lambs does not routinely aid in the detection of food safety hazards that result in meat-borne illnesses. (ii) Hands are capable of spreading or adding contamination to the carcasses. (iii) FSIS inspection systems must reflect science-based decisions as they pertain to meat-borne illnesses consistent with a Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point environment.",p
Alkaline-fermented foods: a review with emphasis on pidan fermentation.,"Alkaline-fermented foods constitute a group of less-known food products that are widely consumed in Southeast Asia and African countries. They can be made from different raw ingredients. For instance, Japanese natto, Thai thua-nao, and kinema are made from cooked soybeans, dawadawa from African locust beans, ogiri from melon seeds, ugba from African oil beans, kawal from fresh legale leaves, owoh from cotton seeds, and pidan from fresh poultry eggs. In alkaline-fermented foods, the protein of the raw materials is broken down into amino acids and peptides; ammonia is released during the fermentation, raising the pH of the final products and giving the food a strong ammoniacal smell. Most alkaline fermentations are achieved spontaneously by mixed bacteria cultures, principally dominated by Bacillus subtilis. In other cases, pure cultures can be used. For example, Japanese natto is inoculated with a pure culture of B. subtilis var natto. Pidan is a special example of alkaline fermentation. Instead of using microorganisms, pidan is made using an alkali-treated fermentation. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is produced from the reaction of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), water (H2O), and calcium oxide (CaO) of pickle or coating mud. NaOH penetrates into the eggs, causing the physicochemical changes, color changes, and gelation. The appearance of pidan differs from fresh eggs in that the white becomes a semitransparent tea-brown color, and the yolk is solid or semisolid with a dark-green color. The nutritional value of pidan is slightly decreased compared with fresh eggs, but pidan has an extremely long shelf life and a pleasant, fragrant taste that is preferred by most people in Southeast Asian countries. In a small-scale laboratory study conducted by the authors, B. subtilis was not found in pidan. Four Staphylococcus spp. (S. cohnii, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. warneri) and two strains of Bacillus spp. (B. cereus and B. macerans) were isolated from pidan. Staphylococcus spp. did not contribute to the fermentation and were considered contaminants.",p
Peripheral regulation of food intake in poultry.,"This review focuses on food intake regulation in avian species with the emphasis on sites of action outside of the central nervous system using data obtained mainly with studies involving poultry. Avian species do appear to regulate food intake, and there is good evidence that both the gastrointestinal tract and the liver are primary sites for regulation. Although young meat-type chickens may be eating near gut capacity, this does not appear to be the case in older birds. Furthermore, although the crop probably has a role in food intake control when meal feeding, its role during free access feeding is marginal. Food intake can be altered in chickens by infusion of glucose, lipids, epinephrine and possibly amino acids into the liver. The response to such infusions is altered by genotype and feeding state (fed or unfed). In addition, injection of peptides including cholecystokinin, bombesin, and gastrin outside the central nervous system decrease food intake. It is uncertain whether the anorexigenic effect of these peptides is a specific response, or if it is a general response caused by abdominal discomfort. Opioids appear to stimulate food intake with at least part of their effect being from outside of the central nervous system. Therefore, although the central nervous system is involved in food intake control in avian species, there are other sites involved. Furthermore, genetic selection for growth in meat-type chickens has altered the responsiveness of these control mechanisms suggesting that there is genetic variation for these physiological systems.",p
Cassava as a food.,"This review has attempted to examine information pertaining to the role of cassava (Manihot esculenta) as a major food source for a large part of the world population, particularly the countries of South America, Africa, and Asia, where it is primarily a major source of energy for 300 to 500 million people. Its cultivation, usually on small farms with little technology, is estimated to cover on an annual basis about 11 million hectares providing about 105 million tons, more than half of which is consumed by humans. The importance of cassava as an energy source can be seen by its growing demand in the European economic community countries where it forms up to 60% of the balanced diets for swine. Cassava is one of the crops that converts the greatest amount of solar energy into soluble carbohydrates per unit of area, thus 1 kg of moisture-free cassava meal may yield up to about 3750 kcal which would mean that a yearly production of 15 tons of cassava meal per hectare would yield some 56 million kcal. The major limitations of cassava as food appear to be its poor protein content and quality and the rapid post harvest deterioration of its roots which usually prevents their storage in the fresh state for more than a few days. However, in addition to its use for culinary purposes, cassava finds application in industrial products such as an adhesive for laundry purposes, for manufacturing paper, alcohol, butanol, dextrin, adhesive tape, textile sizing, and glue.",p
Gastrointestinal allergy to food: a review.,"Gastrointestinal food allergy still poses a challenge to the clinician because of its variable symptomatology and lack of reliable diagnostic tests. Its prevalence is estimated at 2 approximately 5%, higher in children than in older age-groups. Allergy to food usually diminishes with advancing age. Although a wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions, cow's milk is the most common cause of food allergy in infants and young children. Depending upon the speed of onset of symptoms, immediate and delayed types of food allergy have been described. Gastrointestinal symptoms in food allergy have been explained by alterations in transport across the intestinal wall (increased secretory and/or decreased absorptive functions), increased permeability, and motility of the intestine. The exact pathogenesis of food allergy is still not clear. However, immediate type of food allergy is believed to be mediated by type I hypersensitivity reaction, involving mast cells and food-specific IgE antibodies. The diagnosis of food allergy is based upon a favorable response to an elimination diet and a response to a challenge with the suspected food. The condition is treated by eliminating the allergenic food from diet for as long as 9-12 months in case of cow's milk allergy. While exclusive breast-feeding for the initial four months or more reduces the chances of development of food allergy, the role of diet restrictions in the mother in reducing the incidence of food allergy in the infant is controversial. Data on food allergy from developing countries are limited. This may be due to lack of diagnosis or less attention given to the condition relative to other diseases including infectious diarrheas and acute respiratory infections. The role of cow's milk allergy in the pathogenesis of persistent diarrhoea, a major problem in the developing world, remains speculative. Frequent intestinal infections and reduced secretory IgA, which are associated with malnutrition, alter intestinal permeability and result in an increased uptake of food antigens. The increased antigenic load combined with factors such as an atopic predisposition may initiate an abnormal mucosal immune response resulting in chronic enteropathy.",p

Although a wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions, cow's milk is the most common cause of food allergy in infants and young children. Depending upon the speed of onset of symptoms, immediate and delayed types of food allergy have been described. Gastrointestinal symptoms in food allergy have been explained by alterations in transport across the intestinal wall (increased secretory and/or decreased absorptive functions), increased permeability, and motility of the intestine. The exact pathogenesis of food allergy is still not clear. However, immediate type of food allergy is believed to be mediated by type I hypersensitivity reaction, involving mast cells and food-specific IgE antibodies. The diagnosis of food allergy is based upon a favorable response to an elimination diet and a response to a challenge with the suspected food. The condition is treated by eliminating the allergenic food from diet for as long as 9-12 months in case of cow's milk allergy. While exclusive breast-feeding for the initial four months or more reduces the chances of development of food allergy, the role of diet restrictions in the mother in reducing the incidence of food allergy in the infant is controversial. Data on food allergy from developing countries are limited. This may be due to lack of diagnosis or less attention given to the condition relative to other diseases including infectious diarrheas and acute respiratory infections. The role of cow's milk allergy in the pathogenesis of persistent diarrhoea, a major problem in the developing world, remains speculative. Frequent intestinal infections and reduced secretory IgA, which are associated with malnutrition, alter intestinal permeability and result in an increased uptake of food antigens. The increased antigenic load combined with factors such as an atopic predisposition may initiate an abnormal mucosal immune response resulting in chronic enteropathy.",p
Protein-lipid interactions in food systems: a review.,"Proteins and lipids, both individually or as complexes, play important functional roles in foods. Since the 1970s food scientists have devoted attention to the nature of these interactions and particularly to their effects on functional characteristics of protein-based foods. Previously, most of the published work was devoted to the biochemical aspects of protein-lipid interactions in biological systems. This article reviews the protein-lipid interactions of both naturally occurring protein-lipid complexes and protein-lipid complexes formed by induced interactions in foods and food products. The physicochemical characteristics of known protein-lipid complexes, the nature of binding which results in formation of these complexes and the effect of the interactions on food functionality are reviewed.",p

Skin manifestations of food allergy.,"The pediatrician is faced with evaluating a panoply of skin rashes, a subset of which may be induced by food allergy. Acute urticaria is a common manifestation of an allergic skin response to food, but food is rarely a cause of chronic urticaria. Approximately one third of infants/children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have food allergy. Although diagnosis of acute urticaria provoked by a food may be evident from a straightforward history and confirmed by diagnostic tests to detect food-specific IgE antibody, determination of the role of food allergy in patients with atopic dermatitis is more difficult and may require additional diagnostic maneuvers, including elimination diets and oral food challenges. The immunopathologic basis of food-allergic disorders that affect the skin and a rational approach to diagnosis and treatment are discussed. Additional disorders that are caused by or mimic ones caused by food allergy are reviewed.",p
Rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. One of the most successful therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease has been the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to enhance surviving cholinergic neurotransmission by inhibiting breakdown of released acetylcholine. The first generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as tacrine, revealed major limitations to use including hepatotoxicity. Several second generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have now been introduced, including rivastigmine, which are believed to have superior proprieties. The mode of action and metabolism of rivastigmine suggest that it is unlikely to interact significantly with other medications. This is of particular relevance in elderly AD patients, the majority of whom are likely to be receiving concomitant medication. Large multi-centre trials have been completed in the USA, Canada, Europe and South Africa. Rivastigmine has received EU approval for use in all member states. It has approval in 30 countries but not the US. It is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration, who requested additional analyses in 1998.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.


SEARCH STRATEGY
The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Dementia Group Register of Clinical Trials, other electronic databases and other sources of reports were searched using the terms ENA 713, EXELON, and rivastigmine in addition to the terms for controlled trials in dementia (see the Group's search strategy for full details).


SELECTION CRITERIA
All unconfounded, double-blind, randomised trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered for more than one day and compared to placebo for patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Data were extracted by the reviewer (JSB) and entered into an appropriate meta-analysis. The data extracted were cross-checked by the second reviewer (VI). For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient randomised. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If these data were not available, an analysis of data on patients who completed treatment was conducted.


MAIN RESULTS
There are seven included trials. There are no published reports for two large phase III trials, B304 and B351, although they were completed more than 3 years ago. These are part of the Novartis ADENA programme and comprise 1379 (49%) out of 2803 phase III patients. It is unclear how missing data are replaced in ITT analyses, as reports from the ADENA programme provide no description of the use of this method. This has a profound effect on the results: if the method is substantially the same as LOCF, the benefits of treatment inferred from the analyses described in the publications as ITT, may be exaggerated. The meta-analysis reveals benefits on cognitive function as measured by ADAS-Cog test scores for the higher dose of rivastigmine compared to placebo at 26 weeks and for the lower dose. An additional analysis of ADAS-Cog dichotomised into those showing less than 4 points improvement and those showing 4 or more points improvement at 26 weeks shows benefit for cognitive function for the higher dose of rivastigmine compared to placebo and not for the lower dose. Global clinical state, dichotomised, counting those showing no change or decline, against those showing improvement shows benefit due to lower dose rivastigmine compared to placebo at 26 weeks and not for the higher dose. One trial reported results at 18 weeks and there are no significant differences between higher dose rivastigmine and placebo. One trial reported results at 13 weeks, and there are no significant differences between the 4 or 6 mg/d rivastigmine group and p",p

Machine Learning for Food Review and Recommendation,"  Food reviews and recommendations have always been important for online food

Media for the detection and enumeration of Bacillus cereus in foods: a review.,"Bacillus cereus is an established cause of food poisoning in addition to being a troublesome and persistent contaminant, responsible for a variety of spoilage defects in processed foods and dairy products. A range of diagnostic and selective media has been developed to facilitate the detection and enumeration of B. cereus in routine surveillance situations and food poisoning investigations. These media are reviewed with respect to the selective and diagnostic systems they employ, their ability to recover and differentiate the target organism, and their advantages and limitations in particular applications.",p
Infant feeding - an evaluation of text and taught.,"OBJECTIVE
Study was conducted to 1) assess knowledge of doctors, medical interns and nurses/ANMs regarding exclusive breast-feeding, management of common problems related to breast feeding and appropriate complementary foods 2) review the above aspects in books commonly read by medical and nursing students.


METHODS
Cross-sectional study conducted in the department of Community Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi during a seven-month period on 93 interns, 58 medical officers and 44 nurses/ Auxillary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) with the help of a pre-tested structured multiple choice questionnaire and review of some commonly read books of Pediatrics, Community Medicine and Nursing.


RESULTS
The concept of 'exclusive breast-feeding' was clear to most health personnel but the fact that water should also not be given was not clear in the books reviewed. The books also lacked emphasis on management of common lactation problems and this was also seen in the knowledge of the health personnel.


CONCLUSION
As inappropriate feeding practices are widely prevalent, knowledge of large proportion of health personnel is incorrect and commonly read books are inadequate on this issue, there is need for greater emphasis on this in books and training sessions.",p
Food mutagens.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that diet and dietary behaviors can contribute to human cancer risk. One way that this occurs is through the ingestion of food mutagens. Sporadic cancers result from a gene-environment interactions where the environment includes endogenous and exogenous exposures. In this article, we define environment as dietary exposures in the context of gene-environment interactions. Food mutagens cause different types of DNA damage: nucleotide alterations and gross chromosomal aberrations. Most mutagens begin their action at the DNA level by forming carcinogen-DNA adducts, which result from the covalent binding of a carcinogen or part of a carcinogen to a nucleotide. However the effect of food mutagens in carcinogenesis can be modified by heritable traits, namely, low-penetrant genes that affect mutagen exposure of DNA through metabolic activation and detoxification or cellular responses to DNA damage through DNA repair mechanisms or cell death. There are some clearly identified (e.g., aflatoxin) and suspected (e.g., N-nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or heterocyclic amines) food mutagens. The target organs for these agents are numerous, but there is target-organ specificity for each. Mutagenesis however is not the only pathway that links dietary exposures and cancers. There is growing evidence that epigenetic factors, including changes in the DNA methylation pattern, are causing cancer and can be modified by dietary components. Also DNA damage may be indirect by triggering oxidative DNA damage. When considering the human diet, it should be recognized that foods contain both mutagens and components that decrease cancer risk such as antioxidants. Thus nutritionally related cancers ultimately develop from an imbalance of carcinogenesis and anticarcinogenesis. The best way to assess nutritional risks is through biomarkers, but there is no single biomarker that has been sufficiently validated. Although panels of biomarkers would be the most appropriate, their use as a reflection of target-organ risk remains to be determined. Also even when new biomarkers are developed, their application in target organs is problematic because tissues are not readily available. For now most biomarkers are used in surrogate tissues (e.g., blood, urine, oral cavity cells) that presumably reflect biological effects in target organs. This article reviews the role of food mutagens in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and how their effects are modified by heritable traits and discusses how to identify and evaluate the effects of food mutagens.",p
Nickel content of food and estimation of dietary intake.,"Nickel contents of foods are reviewed. A thorough knowledge of nickel in food is of new relevance. Among dermatologists it is a general opinion that flare of hand eczema can occur after per oral nickel exposure. The prevalence of nickel allergy in the Danish population is 10% for women and 2% for men. Nickel intake from the Danish diet is estimated as 150 microgram/person/day on average. Roots and vegetables, meal, grain and bread relatively supply the average diet with much nickel. Certain food items, e.g. cocoa and chocolate, soya beans, oatmeal, nuts and almonds, fresh and dried legumes, have very high nickel contents. Consumption of these items in larger amounts may increase the nickel intake to 900 micrograms/person/day or more. Within the range of 600-5,600 micrograms of nickel may provoke hand eczema, when given in single doses as nickel sulphate. An obvious question is thus whether nickel in the diet can cause flare of hand eczema. This should and can only be established by provocation studies with low-level nickel diets combined with a single food having a high nickel content.",p
Clinical aspects of food allergy.,"Food allergy affects 2.5% of adults and 6-8% of children, and is a leading cause of life-threatening anaphylactic episodes. Food allergy is defined as an adverse reaction to foods that is mediated immunologically and involves specific IgE or non-IgE mechanisms. In this review only IgE-related food allergy will be considered. Many food allergens are glycoproteins, but they do not share any striking biochemical similarities. The definition of many food proteins at the molecular level has tremendously facilitated our understanding of clinical syndromes and seemingly bizarre observations. Clinical manifestations of food allergy include symptoms of the gastrointestinal, cutaneous and respiratory systems, as well as systemic anaphylaxis. The diagnosis of food allergy involves a stepwise approach, including medical history taking, demonstration of specific IgE and confirmation by oral food challenge. The management of the food-allergic patient at present consists of avoidance of the culprit food and education, while future advances may include specific immunotherapy with modified allergens or DNA vaccination.",p
Are effects of MTHFR (C677T) genotype on BMD confined to women with low folate and riboflavin intake? Analysis of food records from the Danish osteoporosis prevention study.,"We have previously found BMD and fracture risk to be significantly associated with the MTHFR (C677T) polymorphism in healthy postmenopausal women in the first years after menopause. Since then, other cohort studies have suggested that sufficient intake of riboflavin and/or folate may have the potential to prevent development of low BMD in women with the TT genotype. This could to some extent explain why this polymorphism is associated with low BMD or fracture in some study populations and not in others. It would also indicate that fractures associated with the TT genotype could be preventable by vitamin B supplementation. We have, therefore, reviewed baseline food record data from our original study to determine if BMD and fracture associations with the MTHFR genotype depended on the intake of folate, riboflavin, or other members of the vitamin B complex, associated with homocysteine metabolism. We analyzed genotype, BMD, and dietary records from 1700 healthy postmenopausal women who participated in the DOPS study. For the assessment of fracture risk, we used longitudinal observations from 854 women in the control group who remained compliant with their initial allocation of no treatment. Riboflavin intake was significantly correlated with femoral neck (FN) BMD in women with the TT genotype (r = 0.24, P < 0.01). FN and lumbar spine (LS) BMD were only associated with the MTHFR genotype in the lowest quartile of riboflavin intake. At the FN, similar threshold effects were shown for folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6. Among these vitamin B complex members, stepwise regression analysis identified riboflavin as the only significant predictor of FN BMD in the TT genotype. In conclusion, we confirm reports that BMD in the MTHFR TT genotype is only significantly reduced in the lowest quartile of riboflavin, B12, B6, and folate intake, at least at the time of menopause. Vitamin B supplementation would only be expected to benefit BMD in about 2% of the population, i.e., those with the TT genotype and low vitamin B intake.",p
Chemical-induced autoimmune reactions and Spanish toxic oil syndrome. Focus on hydantoins and related compounds.,"Autoimmune diseases comprise a wide spectrum of overlapping, systemic and organ-specific disorders. Although, etiology and pathogenesis of such disorders are largely unknown, endogenous host factors and exogenous agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and small molecular weight chemicals, drugs and food components, are believed to be involved. The toxicological significance of low molecular weight compounds on induction of autoimmune disorders is illustrated by the toxic oil syndrome (TOS), a chemically induced epidemic, observed in Spain since 1981. The causative chemical(s) of TOS is still elusive, but an association between ingestion of refined aniline-adulterated rapeseed oil and the syndrome is well-documented. Epidemiological, clinical and immunopathological symptoms of TOS are briefly reviewed. The striking resemblance with immunological disorders, observed in man upon medication with hydantoins and related compounds, is demonstrated. The likeliness of formation of a hydantoin-related compound in the aniline-adulterated oil is evidenced and its role as possible toxic agent in TOS is proposed. Further, the presence of hydantoins and related compounds in food is briefly reviewed and it is suggested that these chemicals may account for a portion of idiopathic autoimmune diseases observed in man. The need for development of animal models to assess this kind of immunotoxicological effects is stressed.",p
"Evaluation of e-beam, gamma- and X-ray treatment on the chemistry and safety of polymers used with pre-packaged irradiated foods: a review.","Polymers used to package food intended for irradiation must currently receive separate US FDA approvals for e-beam, gamma and X-radiation. The three forms of irradiation have virtually indistinguishable effects on polymers held in vacuum. However, in air, irradiation damage is favoured by slow dose rates, such as that characteristic of gamma irradiation. Irrespective of irradiation type, theory and existing polymer irradiation literature both suggest that radiolytic products in food contact polymers should not present a health hazard due to migration into the foods they contain. Equations are presented which calculate the FDA allowable content of radiolytic products to achieve 'threshold of regulation' clearance and conversion of radiolytic yield values (G-values) into ppb concentration in the treated polymer in conformance with FDA practice. An approach to quantifying the functional barrier of a polymer is discussed.",p
Chromatographic determination of carotenoids in foods.,"In recent years, there has been particular emphasis on obtaining more accurate data on the types and concentrations of carotenoids in foods for various health and nutrition activities. The analysis of carotenoids is complicated because of the diversity and the presence of cis-trans isomeric forms of this group of compounds. In addition, a wide variety of food products of vegetal and animal origin, vegetables and animal samples contain carotenoids, and a great range of carotenoids can be found in these samples. The characteristic conjugated double bond system of carotenoids produces the main problem associated with work and manipulation on carotenoids, that is their particular instability, especially towards light, heat, oxygen and acids. For this reason, several precautions are necessary when handling carotenoids. Another problem associated with analysis of carotenoids is the difficulty in obtaining standard compounds. High-performance liquid chromatographic methods for the determination of carotenoids in foods are reviewed. The sample extraction and treatment, carotenoid purification and standard manipulation are briefly commented on. We present a critical assessment of chromatographic methods developed for the determination of carotenoids in foods. Finally, some methods for carotenoid ester separation are reviewed.",p
Discovery of new adverse drug reactions. A review of the Food and Drug Administration's spontaneous reporting system.,"Recently, several studies of spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) have reported on the published literature's role in producing first reports of new adverse drug reactions. In order to provide further information on other components of SRS, the Food and Drug Administration's SRS was examined with regard to its effectiveness and efficiency in identifying new adverse drug reactions and the form, consistency, and timeliness of its communication of new adverse drug reactions to the medical community. While there was evidence that the literature was more effective in producing first reports of new adverse drug reactions for the years compared, there was reason to conclude that FDA's SRS was capable of making a contribution to the alerting process. Moreover, direct participation by practitioners in FDA's SRS was found to be the most efficiently obtained FDA source of new adverse drug reaction reports.",p
Outbreak of campylobacteriosis at a senior center.,"OBJECTIVES
In August 1997, campylobacteriosis was diagnosed in four older persons in one Connecticut town. We investigated this outbreak to determine its cause and to identify appropriate preventive measures. We also analyzed surveillance data to assess the impact of campylobacteriosis among persons age 65 years and older in Connecticut.


DESIGN
The outbreak was investigated through a case-control study and an environmental investigation. Surveillance data were from population-based, active foodborne disease surveillance.


SETTING
The outbreak and environmental studies were conducted at a senior center identified as the one eating place common to all four patients. Active surveillance data were from three Connecticut counties during 1996/1997.


PARTICIPANTS
We administered a questionnaire to senior center attendees. A case was defined as onset of diarrhea with fever or abdominal cramps during August 20-25 in a person who ate at the senior center during August 18-20. Respondents without illness meeting the case definition who ate at the senior center during August 18-20 were controls.


MEASUREMENTS
Case-control study participants were asked about symptoms of gastrointestinal illness and meals and foods eaten at the center. The environmental investigation gathered information about food preparation procedures and facilities. Active surveillance data were analyzed to determine age-specific annual campylobacteriosis incidence rates and proportions of cases involving hospitalization.


RESULTS
For the case-control study, there were 66 respondents (16 case patients, 50 controls), representing approximately 52% of August 18-20 attendees. Case patients were more likely than controls to have eaten at a Hawaiian luau at the center. The most strongly implicated food was sweet potatoes. Review of food preparation procedures identified multiple opportunities for cross-contamination from raw meats to other foods. In Connecticut's active surveillance area during 1996/1997, the annual campylobacteriosis incidence rate was highest among young adults, but the proportion of hospitalized cases was highest among persons age 70 years and older.


CONCLUSION
Campylobacter transmission occurred at the luau, likely because of cross-contamination in the kitchen. This investigation emphasizes the importance of strict separation of raw meats from other foods during preparation. Careful attention to these measures is particularly important when an older population is served.",p
"Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora and their impact on foods: a review.","While the risk from pathogenic microorganisms in foods has been recognized for hundreds of years, bacterial agents are generally implicated as the contaminants. Although many outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by protozoan pathogens have occurred, it is only in the last 3 years that attention has focused on protozoan association with foodborne transmission. Recognized as waterborne parasites, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora have now been associated with several foodborne outbreaks. The oocysts and cysts of these organisms can persist and survive for long periods of time both in water and on foods. While Cyclospora oocysts require a maturation period, Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts are immediately infectious upon excretion from the previous host. As a result, these parasites have emerged as public health risks and have become a concern to the food industry. More than 200 cases of foodborne giardiasis (seven outbreaks) were reported from 1979 to 1990. Four foodborne Cryptosporidium outbreaks (with a total of 252 cases) have been documented since 1993. Cyclospora caused a series of sporadic outbreaks of cyclosporasis throughout North America that have affected over 3,038 people since 1995. Control and prevention of protozoan foodborne disease depends upon our ability to prevent, remove, or kill protozoan contaminants. This review will address the biology, foodborne and waterborne transmission, survival, and methods for detection and control of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora.",p
Cidofovir use in acyclovir-resistant herpes infection.,"Herpes infections continue to be prevalent, especially in immunocompromised patients. Some of these patients will develop resistant HSV infections. Therefore, it is important to explore new treatment options. Animal studies have shown cidofovir to be effective in the treatment and prevention of HSV infections. Human data are limited, with only one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed to date. The results from this study look promising; however, due to the small sample size, a larger clinical trial is warranted. The human data available as case reports are suboptimal in the quality of reporting time frames for resolution of lesions/symptoms and outcomes of therapy. Another problem with the case report data is that the TK status of the herpes simplex isolates was not reported. This would have helped substantiate the acyclovir resistance seen in these patients. It was evident in these case reports that acyclovir resistance can be overcome, as acyclovir-resistant strains became sensitive following cidofovir therapy. This may be because TK(+) viruses have been shown to establish latency more readily than do TK(-) viruses. This pattern suggests that alternating between acyclovir and cidofovir therapies may provide a strategy to manage the emergence of alternatively acyclovir-sensitive and -resistant infections. At present, only the intravenous formulation of cidofovir is commercially available. Advantages of the intravenous formulation include weekly dosing and efficacy. Disadvantages are the complexity of administration and the adverse effect profile. The most common adverse effects with this formulation include nephrotoxicity manifested as proteinuria (12%), and increased creatinine (5%) and neutropenia (15%). Administration of probenecid and NaCl 0.9% hydration are used to reduce the incidence and severity of nephrotoxicity in patients who are receiving cidofovir. Probenecid also has toxicities, including nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, and flushing. The topical formulation of cidofovir looks promising for mucocutaneous HSV infection because it is usually undetectable in the blood following topical administration. Therefore, systemic adverse effects should be minimized. A cidofovir gel product (Forvade, Gilead Sciences) is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of refractory HSV. Ultimately, more controlled clinical studies are necessary to determine whether routine cidofovir use can be justified in patients with acyclovir-resistant HSV infection.",p
"Sociologic study of food habits--a review. II. Differentiation, accessibility and solidarity.","The process of changing food habits is more complex than would appear to most nutritionists; it involves much more than the collection of information. Change must be studied from a multidisciplinary, chiefly a sociologic, point of view, since the food habits of families within a community are formed in a matrix of human relationships. Three major variables are presented and discussed: (a)differentiation, the capacity to process information; (b)accessibility, the measured distance between a family and an information source; and (c)solidarity, the ability of a family group to react cohesively to proposed change. To effect change in his dietary habits, an individual needs his family's cooperation. The nutritionist will do well to rely on the findings of social scientists if proposed changes in family food habits are to be implemented.",p
Clinical and prophylactic trials with assured new treatment for those at greater risk: I. A design proposal.,"OBJECTIVES
The accepted sine qua non for estimating the difference in efficacy between a new and a standard treatment is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Yet in some situations it is either practically or ethically impossible to conduct such a trial. For example, patients who are desperately ill may decline to participate when they learn they may not receive the new treatment, especially when that treatment is readily available outside the experimental protocol. Likewise, in a prophylactic trial of a promising vaccine, recruitment of persons at greater risk may falter or fail. Our objective is to demonstrate that a rigorous comparison of treatments may still be attainable.


METHODS
The features of a controlled clinical or prophylactic trial are reviewed from the perspectives of Food and Drug Administration regulations, ethical considerations, and practical problems.


RESULTS
An explicit risk-based allocation method of design and analysis is proposed, one guaranteeing that all subjects at greater risk will receive the new treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
Under certain conditions, a risk-based allocation trial can furnish consistent estimates of both standard and experimental treatment effects for those at greater risk while avoiding certain difficulties caused by randomized treatment allocation.",p
Fortification of the diet as a strategy for preventing iron deficiency.,"Progress in the fortification of food with iron is reviewed in the light of the different circumstances prevailing in the developed and developing world. Although fortification programmes are well established in developed countries many were not based on sound principles and there is no good evidence that they have proved effective. The important steps in establishing a fortification programme include accurate establishment of the need for iron fortification in a particular group or population, the choice of an appropriate combination of food vehicle and iron compound which is both stable and acceptable, and confirmation that the iron in the chosen blend is bioavailable and in different dietary settings. Only after the successful completion of controlled field trials using the chosen combination is the establishment of a regional or national fortification programme worthwhile. These points are illustrated by the success of field trials in the developing world, at least one of which has led to the implementation of a national programme directed to infants and children. Finally, a case study is described in which these principles were followed in the planning and execution of a successful field trial in an iron deficient Indian population in South Africa. The vehicle was curry powder and the iron compound Fe(111)EDTA.",p
Children's preferences for high-fat foods.,"Many high-fat foods are highly preferred by adults, and children soon acquire these preferences. The circumstances and mechanisms that contribute to establishing children's preferences for high-fat foods are the subject of this review.",p
Food consumption data in microbiological risk assessment.,"The 1st International Conference on Microbiological Risk Assessment: Foodborne Hazards was held in July 2002. One of the goals of that conference was to evaluate the current status and future needs and directions of the science of microbial risk assessment. This article is based in part on a talk presented at that meeting. Here, we review the types of food consumption data available for use in microbial risk assessments and address their strengths and limitations. Consumption data available range from total population summary data derived from food production statistics to detailed information, derived from national food consumption surveys, about the types and amounts of food consumed at the individual level. Although population summary data are available for most countries, detailed data are available for a limited number of countries and may only be available in summary format. Despite the relatively large amount of detailed information collected by these national surveys, information crucial to microbial risk assessments, such as the specific types of foods, the eating patterns of susceptible populations, or an individual's propensity for consuming high-risk foods (e.g., eating undercooked hamburgers, raw shellfish, or temperature-abused foods), are not collected during these surveys.",p
Children's food patterns--a review: II. Family and group behavior.,"Several themes have been presented in this review of research on children's food habits. Even though each of these themes helps advance the study of children's food behavior, how are the findings related and how does the nutritionist apply the findings in education programs? A theoretical model is needed that can be used with families anywhere in the world--those that have problems feeding children, as well as those that do not. The model should also provide solutions for many problems of food behavior and help nutritionists decide on alternatives for nutrition education programs. Such a model would adapt the themes presented in this article into conceptual abstractions with cross-cultural utility in explaining how food habits change. For example, many of the themes in this article could represent family solidarity (e.g., cooperation, communication, cohesiveness, and organization) (32, 70, 77, 126). Familiarity, adult and peer models, positive reinforcement, discipline, parent-child stimulation, family organization, and parental relationships suggest different ways to measure the family situation. In other words, each of these themes illustrates ways to develop cultural specific measure of one concept--family solidarity (32). In the information-processing model, family solidarity is considered the influencing variable to explain food habits (32). By this model, just presenting information does not guarantee its use. Rather, the use of nutrition information depends on the family situation. If family members share information and decide to use it, then food problems will be solved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",p
Assessment of the food safety issues related to genetically modified foods.,"International consensus has been reached on the principles regarding evaluation of the food safety of genetically modified plants. The concept of substantial equivalence has been developed as part of a safety evaluation framework, based on the idea that existing foods can serve as a basis for comparing the properties of genetically modified foods with the appropriate counterpart. Application of the concept is not a safety assessment per se, but helps to identify similarities and differences between the existing food and the new product, which are then subject to further toxicological investigation. Substantial equivalence is a starting point in the safety evaluation, rather than an endpoint of the assessment. Consensus on practical application of the principle should be further elaborated. Experiences with the safety testing of newly inserted proteins and of whole genetically modified foods are reviewed, and limitations of current test methodologies are discussed. The development and validation of new profiling methods such as DNA microarray technology, proteomics, and metabolomics for the identification and characterization of unintended effects, which may occur as a result of the genetic modification, is recommended. The assessment of the allergenicity of newly inserted proteins and of marker genes is discussed. An issue that will gain importance in the near future is that of post-marketing surveillance of the foods derived from genetically modified crops. It is concluded, among others that, that application of the principle of substantial equivalence has proven adequate, and that no alternative adequate safety assessment strategies are available.",p
Neural and hormonal factors in peptic ulcer disease.,"The cause of duodenal ulcer (DU) is unknown, but gastric acid and pepsin must be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder: (1) Patients with massive acid hypersecretion due to gastrinoma almost develop peptic ulcer, usually duodenal; (2) ordinary DU patients, on the average, secrete much more acid basally and also have larger acid secretory capacities than healthy people; and (3) reduction of gastric acid secretion (e.g., with cimetidine) accelerates DU healing and prevents DU from recurring. Although factors responsible for increased basal acid secretion rates and for increased maximal secretory capacity (parietal cell mass) in many DU patients are not completely understood, it is likely that neural and hormonal factors are involved: The stomachs of some DU patients may be under increased vagal drive in the basal state. Parietal cells of DU patients are more sensitive to the hormone gastrin, which is released by food. In this review, evidence for abnormalities in vagal function and gastrin physiology in DU will be discussed, with emphasis on recent developments.",p
Tin in canned food: a review and understanding of occurrence and effect.,"Tinplate is light gauge, steel sheet or strip, coated on both sides with commercially pure tin and has been used for well over a hundred years as a robust form of food packaging. Altogether, about 25,000 million food cans are produced and filled in Europe per annum, about 20% of these having plain internal (unlacquered) tin-coated steel bodies. Worldwide, the total for food packaging is approximately 80,000 million cans. Tinplate is also extensively used for the production of beverage cans. Europe produces and fills over 15,000 million tinplate beverage cans per annum all of which are internally lacquered. The use of tinplate for food and beverage packaging, will result in some tin dissolving into the food content, particularly when plain uncoated internal surfaces are used. The Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake for tin is 14 mg/kg body weight and recommended maximum permissible levels of tin in food are typically 250 mg/kg (200 mg/kg UK) for solid foods and 150 mg/kg for beverages. However, the question arises as to whether evidence exists that such elevated levels of tin in food in any way constitute a risk to human health. This review considers the factors affecting the dissolution of tin, the reported measurements/surveys of actual levels of tin in canned foods and the studies and reports of acute (short term) toxicity relating to the ingestion of elevated levels of tin in food products. Chronic studies are mentioned, but are not covered in detail, since the review is mainly concerned with possible effects from the ingestion of single high doses. From published data, there appears to be a small amount of evidence suggesting that consumption of food or beverages containing tin at concentrations at or below 200 ppm has caused adverse gastrointestinal effects in an unknown but possibly small proportion of those exposed. However, the evidence supporting this assertion is derived from reports of adverse effects which offer data that are limited, incomplete or of uncertain veracity. Clinical studies provide greater confidence regarding the effects of exposure concentration and dose, but few relevant studies have been made. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were observed in limited clinical studies at concentrations of 700 ppm or above, although no adverse gastrointestinal effects were also reported in two studies at higher concentrations. Overall, therefore, the published data do not present a particularly comprehensive profile on the toxic hazard to man of acute exposure to divalent inorganic tin. A food survey suggested that the contents of almost 4% of plain internal tinplate food cans contain over 150 mg/kg of tin and over 2.5 million such cans are consumed every year in the UK alone. Despite this, in the last 25 years, there have been no reports of acute effects attributable to tin contamination in the range 100-200 ppm. These facts strongly suggest that there is little evidence for an association between the consumption of food containing tin at concentrations up to 200 ppm and significant acute adverse gastrointestinal effects. Clearly though, only further clinical studies will generate unequivocal evidence that current legislative limits provide safe levels for adults in the general population.",p
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: a problem of the mucosal immune system?,"The gastrointestinal immune system is a major component of the mucosal barrier, which provides an appropriate immunologic homeostasis between host and numerous foreign antigens, including microbial and dietary antigens. However, under certain pathological circumstances created by disturbance of the immunologic balance, allergic responses associated with the gastrointestinal tract can be triggered by abnormal immune responses against selected food protein antigens. Among the several types of immune competent cells, eosinophils are generally considered to play a central role for the development of allergic diseases in gastrointestinal tissue. Although most research has been focused on the molecular and cellular understanding of eosinophils in the peripheral tissues and lung, recent studies elucidate the unique trafficking and regulation mechanisms of eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tissues. In this review, we summarize current findings in the regulatory mechanism of gastrointestinal eosinophils. Furthermore, several unique murine models for eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which can be applied for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms of eosinophil-mediated gastrointestinal allergy, and the development of new mucosal immune therapy for the control of food allergy are reviewed.",p
"Commercially available ocular hypotensive products: preservative concentration, stability, storage, and in-life utilization.","PURPOSE
With the recent addition of several new ocular hypotensive agents to the pharmacopeia, glaucomatologists have more choices in selection of pharmacotherapy. Several of these new agents have special storage requirements or a limited shelf-life when stored under certain conditions.


METHODS
To better inform physicians and patients about pharmaceutical issues relating to the correct usage or storage of ophthalmic products used to manage glaucoma, the authors reviewed the US Food and Drug Administration requirements for sterile ophthalmic preparations, together with the United States Pharmacopeia 24. They also reviewed the Ophthalmic Physicians Desk Reference (2000 edition) for pharmaceutical information regarding branded glaucoma-solution products.


RESULTS
The US Food and Drug Administration requires that both analytical tests (e.g., concentration of preservative) and functional tests (e.g., preservative efficacy tests) be undertaken to show the sterility of liquid products. In addition, extensive chemical testing of the potency and stability of the active molecule and other physicochemical properties of the formulation are needed to justify expiration dates and determine the shelf-life of the product. Of the 19 products that met the search criteria, 17 (89%) used benzalkonium chloride as the primary preservative agent, in weight-to-volume ratios ranging from 0.004% (Betagan, Optipranolol) to 0.020% (Xalatan). Five products had a warning against freezing, and 12 required protection from light. Only one product required refrigerated storage before opening, though most products specify an upper range for temperature exposure during storage.


CONCLUSIONS
Physicians and their patients need to be aware of the special requirements of each product to assure that they receive the dose of medication as prescribed. The distinction between stability during storage before dispensing (shelf-life) and the acceptable ""in-use life"" after opening of the dispensed product are essential for the safe and efficacious management of glaucoma.",p
Modern medical management of obesity: the role of pharmaceutical intervention.,"The medical model of obesity treatment--combining diet, exercise, and behavior modification with antiobesity agents--suffered a setback when fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were withdrawn from the market because of an association between these medications and valvular regurgitation. The Food and Drug Administration has recently approved sibutramine (Meridia), a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor that was originally developed as an antidepressant, but which has also been shown to reduce weight. In a 1-year placebo-controlled trial, 65% of patients receiving 15 mg sibutramine daily lost more than 5% of their body weight, compared with 29% of patients receiving a placebo; 39% of patients in the sibutramine group lost more than 10% of their body weight, compared with 8% of patients in the placebo group. Health benefits observed in patients receiving sibutramine include reductions in levels of triglycerides, uric acid, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Another antiobesity drug currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration is orlistat (Xenical), a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces the absorption of dietary fat by approximately 30%, thus reducing energy intake. In a 1-year placebo-controlled trial, 55% of patients receiving orlistat lost more than 5% of their body weight, and 25% lost more than 10% of their body weight, compared with 33% and 15%, respectively, of patients in the placebo group. In addition, orlistat slowed the rate of weight regain in the second year of treatment. Health benefits demonstrated in clinical trials of orlistat include reduced LDL cholesterol levels and increased levels of HDL cholesterol, reduced blood pressure and fasting insulin levels, improved oral glucose tolerance test outcomes, and improved glycemic control in obese patients with diabetes. The future of the pharmacologic treatment of obesity is promising. Many new antiobesity agents are in the early stages of development, and our understanding of the body's weight-regulating mechanisms is advancing steadily. Human trials of recombinant leptin are underway. Other promising compounds include those that block the Neuropeptide Y5 and Y1 (NY5, NY1) and Melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptors, stimulate uncoupling proteins, and unbind corticotrophin-releasing factor from its binding protein. As better medical treatments for obesity become available, the focus in dietary prescription may shift away from reducing energy intake toward healthier eating for disease prevention. At present, a comprehensive approach, which, in some patients, may include medical therapy as an adjunct, is necessary to treat obesity effectively.",p
Treatment of venous ulcers with human skin equivalent.,"In the author's clinical experience in rating venous ulcers, human skin equivalent has been efficacious, safe, cost-effective, and easy to use. This innovation is likely to become an important therapeutic tool for podiatric physicians who treat venous ulcers. Leg ulcers are a large economic burden to society, both in direct and total costs, including patient time lost from work for labor- and time-intensive therapies. The cost-containing measures of the managed care environment encourage treatment of venous ulcers in an outpatient center. Because human skin equivalent can be applied in such a setting, podiatric physicians will be able to treat venous ulcers routinely without referring patients to more costly settings such as hospitals or surgical centers. Because human skin equivalent is an effective alternative to standard venous ulcer therapies, this agent, which is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration, should provide a viable treatment that may reduce the total costs associated with venous ulcer care.",p
Sociologic study of food habits--a review. I. Diversity in diet and scalogram analysis.,"Scalogram analysis (Guttman scaling) organizes descriptive data into a form which is meaningful to the nutritionist and the sociologist in the study of the diversity in, and variation of, family food patterns. Scalogram analysis avoids the use of measures that are ""description bound"" or culturally biased by providing a means of using a higher level of abstraction in studying food habits. Scalogram analysis can be useful, both in planning and in evaluating programs of nutrition education, but until this tool becomes more familiar to nutrition educators and its effectiveness is evaluated in actual situations, it will remain only potentially useful.",p
Mutagens and carcinogens in foods. Epidemiologic review.,"Evidence that diet contributes to the development of cancer is strengthening.

Such substances are present in minute quantities in the diets of average Canadians. Indication of health risk is largely limited to experimental laboratory evidence.",p
Regulatory action criteria for filth and other extraneous materials.I. Review of hard or sharp foreign objects as physical hazards in food.,"A review of the scientific literature concerning physical hazards in food products is combined with the results of 190 evaluations of foreign objects in food that were conducted by the FDA Health Hazard Evaluation Board over a period of 25 years. Hard or sharp objects 7 mm or longer in size were found to be a potential health hazard from laceration, perforation wound, and possible secondary infection. Objects less than 7 mm in size represent a possible hazard, especially if a special-risk group (e.g., infants, elderly) is among the intended consumers of the product. The results proved consistent with U.S. Department of Agriculture guidance concerning foreign objects in food. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point applications for physical hazards in food are discussed.",p
Generally recognized as safe (GRAS): history and description.,"Generally recognized as safe (GRAS), a system for review and approval of ingredients for addition to food, was conceived at a time when the need for a less doctrinaire review of food ingredients was critical. The GRAS approval process for a food ingredient relies on the judgment of ""...experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety..."" the end product of which is no better or worse than that by FDA, but often more expeditious. The process and requirements for a successful GRAS determination are discussed and compared with that of the food additive petition (FAP) process. The future of the GRAS process is assured by its history of successful performance, bringing safe food ingredients to the consumer in a timely manner.",p
Heritability and diagnosis of congenital abnormalities in food animals.,"The heritability and diagnosis of congenital abnormalities in food animals have been reviewed from the viewpoint of practitioners, clinicians, and researchers.

Implications of recent advances in genetic methodology are noted.",p
Biopsychobehavioral model of risk of severe hypoglycemia. Self-management behaviors.,"OBJECTIVE
To identify self-management antecedents of low blood glucose (BG) (< 3.9 mmol/l) that might be easily recognized, treated, or avoided altogether.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Ninety-three adults with type 1 diabetes (age, 35.8 +/- 8 years [mean +/- SD]; duration of diabetes, 17.0 +/- 11 years; daily insulin dose, 0.58 +/- 0.18 U/kg; and HbAlc, 8.6 +/- 1.8%) were recruited to participate in the study. Of the 93 subjects, 42 had a history of severe hypoglycemia (SH), defined as two or more hypoglycemic episodes in the preceding 12 months, and 51 subjects had no history of SH (No-SH) in the same time period. Before each of 70 BG measurements obtained over a 3-week period, subjects used a handheld computer to record whether their most recent insulin, food, and exercise was more than, less than, or the same as usual. Associations among self-management behaviors preceding BG readings < 3.9 mmol/l versus those preceding BG readings of 5.6-7.8 mmol/l were determined using chi 2 tests, analyses of variance, and logistic regression analyses.


RESULTS
Analysis of 6,425 self-management/self-monitoring of BG events revealed that the usual amounts of insulin, food, and exercise preceded the events 58.3% of the time. No significant differences were observed for changes in insulin before readings of BG < 3.9 mmol/l versus 7.8 < BG > 5.6 mmol/l, but significantly less food (P < 0.01) was eaten and more exercise (P < 0.001) was performed before the low BG measurement. No interactions between SH and No-SH groups and management behaviors were observed. However, each of the three management variables entered significantly in a logistic model that predicted 61% of all readings of BG < 3.9 mmol/l.


CONCLUSIONS
Subjects with a history of SH did not report managing their diabetes differently from those with no such history. Specifically, when low BG occurred, the preceding management behaviors, although predictive of low BG, were not different in SH and No-SH subjects. Overall, self-management behaviors did not distinguish SH from No-SH subjects. Thus, even though it might be beneficial for all patients to review their food and exercise management decisions to reduce their frequency of low BG, an educational intervention whose content stresses insulin, food, and exercise would be unlikely by itself to be sufficient to reduce the frequency of SH.",p
Role of food allergy in atopic dermatitis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Food allergy and atopic dermatitis often occur in the same patient. Based on clinical data from the past few decades, it is clear that foods such as cow's milk and hen's eggs can directly provoke flares of atopic dermatitis particularly in sensitized infants, whereas inhaled allergens and pollen-related foods are of greater importance in older children, adolescents and adults. Because the role and immunology of food allergy in atopic dermatitis remain controversial, here we review data that mainly focus on skin eczema and food allergy.


RECENT FINDINGS
Clinical studies have revealed that more than 50% of all children with atopic dermatitis that can be exacerbated by certain foods will react with a worsening of skin eczema alone or in addition to immediate symptoms. Adolescents and adults also react to foods, but reactions to 'classical' food allergens such as hen's eggs and cow's milk are not as common as in childhood. Subgroups of children and of adults with atopic dermatitis do, however, react to pollen-associated foods. Both immunoglobulin E associated and independent T-cell mediated responses appear to be involved in clinical eczematous reactions.


SUMMARY
Food-induced eczema should be diagnosed only by a thorough diagnostic procedure, taking into account the patient's history, the degree of sensitization and the clinical relevance of the sensitization. More clinical and immunological studies are needed to unravel the pathophysiology and the different rates of clinical responsiveness to different foodstuffs in patients with atopic dermatitis.",p
"Food biotechnology review: traditional solid-state fermentations of plant raw materials--application, nutritional significance, and future prospects.","This review on the use of indigenous solid-state fermentations (SSF) describes the microbiological transformation of plant raw materials into highly nutritious foods and flavor-enhancing ingredients. Traditional fermented foods from most countries of the world may be classified into the following categories: fungal fermentation followed by brining, SSF principally using bacteria, lactic acid fermentation followed by fungal fermentation, production of fermented doughs, alcoholic fermentation, and fermented food ingredients. Scientific studies of the principles behind SSF, identification of the essential microorganisms, development of suitable and versatile equipment, control of the process, and quality control of the substrate and final product can very well lead to a substantial increase at a world level in the availability and consumption of these fermented foods. The application of modern biotechnology in some countries is already changing the ancient methods of making fermented foods.",p
Adiposity signals and the control of energy homeostasis.,"Recent technologic innovations have enabled probing the workings of individual cells and even molecules. As a result, our knowledge of the biological controls over eating and the regulation of body adiposity is increasing at a rapid pace. We review the evidence that food intake is controlled by separate but interacting groups of molecular signals. One group, termed satiety signals, are proportional to what is being consumed and help to determine meal size. Cholecystokinin is the best known of these, and its premeal administration causes a dose-dependent reduction of meal size. In and of itself, however, cholecystokinin (and other satiety signals) has little impact on body-fat stores. The second group, termed adiposity signals, circulate in proportion to body adiposity and enter the brain, where they interact with satiety signals in the brainstem and hypothalamus. Insulin and leptin are the best known of these adiposity signals, and the administration of either into the brain causes a dose-dependent reduction of both food intake and body weight. Within the brain, parallel but opposing pathways originating in the hypothalamic arcuate nuclei integrate adiposity signals with satiety signals. Those with a net anabolic effect increase food intake and reduce energy expenditure and are represented (among many such signals) by neuropeptide Y; those with a net catabolic effect decrease food intake and energy expenditure and are represented by brain melanocortins. This complex regulatory mechanism allows individuals to adapt their feeding schedule to idiosyncratic environmental constraints, eating whenever it is desirable or possible. Body-weight regulation occurs as adiposity signals alter the efficacy of meal-generated satiety signals.",p
"FDA's conduct, review, and evaluation of inspections of clinical investigators.","This review of the Food and Drug Administration's Bioresearch Monitoring Program focuses on the inspection of clinical investigators who study investigational drugs. The differences between routine, ""for-cause,"" and bioequivalency/bioavailability inspections are examined, with emphasis on the responsibilities of the clinical investigator, reasons for conducting the inspections, and problems found. Important aspects of the inspection report, such as protocol adherence, records maintenance, informed consent, institutional review board approval, and drug accountability, are outlined. The disqualification and consent agreement processes for investigators with serious problems are explained. FDA policies on third-party notification and remote data entry are noted.",p
In-vitro diagnosis: serum-based methods used for risk assessment of allergenic food.,"This review on in-vitro diagnostic methods focuses on the use of methods to perform risk assessment on foods. Based on the International Life Science Institute (ILSI) risk decision tree, the methods are discussed and three scenarios are suggested: (i) testing for a well-known allergen; (ii) testing for a well-known allergen, but with no previous history of food allergy; and (iii) testing for unknown allergens and cross-reactivity with known allergens.",p
The quarterly review of biology.,"In recent years, the evidence suggesting that honey bees communicate with a ""dance language"" has been stronly attached on both theoretical and experimental grounds. An alternative theory has been proposed by which bees are supposed to use only odors to locate sources of food. A review of the evolution of the controversy isolates and analyzes the main issues. Early experiments which she fundamental problem in this important dispute has been that dancing bees advertise a food location with site-specific odoer information as well as symbolic distance and direction coordinates. A new technique has overcome this problem and demonstrated that von Frisch's dance language theory is, on the whole, correct. The apparently contradictory results of Wenner and his colleagues are shown to be due to their techniques for training bees. The dance-language controversy raises issues beyond how bees communicate. These include whether and when ""evolutionary"" arguments are useful, and to what extent Kuhn's scientific revolution paradign fits the dispute.",p
Cow's milk allergy: a critical review.,"Foods which are ingested frequently, and cow's milk in particular, are a common cause of delayed-in-onset allergy. Difficulty in diagnosing milk allergy is encountered because: (1) skin tests are unreliable; (2) the symptoms of milk allergy are frequently delayed in appearing, thereby obscuring their connection with the previously ingested food; (3) when such symptoms do appear, they often fail to suggest allergy as etiologic; and (4) the offending antigen may be present in a milk product not obviously associated with milk per se such as sherbet or cheese. Contrary to common belief, most milk (and other food) allergy is not reagin (IgE) mediated. Milk allergy is not confined to infancy, but is frequently seen in children and adults, often persisting as an allergy which had supposedly been ""outgrown."" Since milk allergy is often a familial disorder, its presence in a patient can assist the physician in possibly discovering it in other members of the family. A two or three-week trial elimination of milk, in conjunction with written dietary instructions for the patient, is presently the only reliable diagnostic procedure.",p
Fluid dairy product quality and safety: looking to the future.,"The fiercely competitive nature of the US beverage industry will drive the fluid milk sector of the dairy industry to improve product quality and shelf life to enable dairy beverages to compete with innovative new introductions as well as with currently popular shelf-stable products. The recent substantial growth in the volume of flavored milk sales specifically suggests that attention is needed to improve these products. Further, increasing public awareness and regulatory attention directed toward food safety issues highlight the need for the dairy industry to proactively address and eliminate emerging food safety issues that may negatively impact the image of dairy products. Shelf life and sensory profiles of high temperature short time pasteurized fluid milk products are presented, illustrating the need for greater attention to controlling contaminating microorganisms in processed fluid milk products. Bacterial spoilage patterns of flavored versus unflavored milks are compared, and suggestions are presented for extending flavored product shelf lives. Strategies currently applied to extend shelf life are reviewed. Food safety issues facing the dairy industry are presented within the context of an overview of foodborne illnesses in the United States. The pressing need to determine thermal resistance characteristics of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is described.",p
Evaluation of isolated cases of salmonellosis by plasmid profile analysis: introduction and transmission of a bacterial clone by precooked roast beef.,"In July-August 1981, the number of isolated cases of salmonellosis in New Jersey and Pennsylvania markedly increased. Concurrently, two outbreaks in these states caused by the same Salmonella serotypes were traced to a single brand of precooked roast beef. Plasmid profiles of outbreak and isolated strains were examined, and Salmonella newport isolates from the implicated meat and from cases in the two outbreaks were identified with a unique profile, present in 45% of reported strains from isolated cases in this area during the same period. Review of the food exposure histories in isolated cases demonstrated association between this plasmid profile and consumption of precooked roast beef (P = 0.003). Examination of S newport strains from other regions and intervals indicated that this strain was introduced into these two states sometime after March 1981. Thus, plasmid profile analysis was useful in studying the epidemiology of isolated cases of salmonellosis due to a sensitive common serotype.",p
Predicted mercury concentrations in hair from infant immunizations: cause for concern.,"Mercury (Hg) is considered one of the worlds most toxic metals. Current thinking suggests that exposure to mercury occurs primarily from seafood contamination and rare catastrophic events. Recently, another common source of exposure has been identified. Thimerosal (TMS), a preservative found in many infant vaccines, contains 49.6% ethyl mercury (EtHg) by weight and typically contributes 25 microg of EtHg per dose of infant vaccine. As part of an ongoing review, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in 1999 that infants who received multiple TMS-preserved vaccines may have been exposed to cumulative Hg in excess of Federal safety guidelines. According to the centers for disease control (CDC) recommended immunization schedule, infants may have been exposed to 12.5 microg Hg at birth, 62.5 microg EtHg at 2 months, 50 microg EtHg at 4 months, 62.5 microg EtHg at 6 months, and 50 microg EtHg at approximately 18 months, for a total of 237.5 microg EtHg during the first 18 months of life, if all TMS-containing vaccines were administered. Neurobehavioral alterations, especially to the more susceptible fetus and infant, are known to occur after relatively low dose exposures to organic mercury compounds. In effort, to further elucidate the levels of ethyl mercury resulting from exposure to vaccinal TMS, we estimated hair Hg concentrations expected to result from the recommended CDC schedule utilizing a one compartment pharmacokinetic model. This model was developed to predict hair concentrations from acute exposure to methymercury (MeHg) in fish. Modeled hair Hg concentrations in infants exposed to vaccinal TMS are in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) safety guidelines of 1 ppm for up to 365 days, with several peak concentrations within this period. More sensitive individuals and those with additional sources of exposure would have higher Hg concentrations. Given that exposure to low levels of mercury during critical stages of development has been associated with neurological disorders in children, including ADD, learning difficulties, and speech delays, the predicted hair Hg concentration resulting from childhood immunizations is cause for concern. Based on these findings, the impact which vaccinal mercury has had on the health of American children warrants further investigation.",p
Excitotoxins in foods.,"Evidence is reviewed pertaining to excitatory neurotoxins (excitotoxins) encountered in human food supply. The most frequently encountered food excitotoxin is glutamate (Glu) which is commercially added to many foods despite evidence that it can freely penetrate certain brain regions and rapidly destroy neurons by hyperactivating the NMDA subtype of Glu receptor. Hypersensitivity of NMDA receptors during development makes the immature nervous system especially sensitive to Glu excitotoxicity. On the other hand, elderly consumers are particularly sensitive to domoic acid, a powerful excitotoxic Glu analog that activates both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. A high content of domoic acid in shell fish caused a recent food poisoning incident that killed some elderly victims and caused brain damage and memory impairment in others. Neurolathyrism is a crippling neurodegenerative condition associated with ingestion of a legume that naturally contains BOAA, an excitotoxic Glu analog that hyperactivates non-NMDA receptors. Thus, the human food supply is a source of excitotoxins that can damage the brain by one type of mechanism to which immature consumers are hypervulnerable, or by other mechanisms to which adult and elderly consumers are peculiarly sensitive.",p
Chemical interactions between additives in foodstuffs: a review.,"This paper critically reviews the key literature on food additive-additive chemical interactions published over the last 30 years together with appropriate relevant information on food additive-food component interactions. Five main classes of food additive are included, reflecting the research effort to date: the sulfur (IV) species of preservatives, synthetic food colouring materials, nitrate and nitrite, ascorbic acid, and sorbic acid. Within each class, aspects of the chemistry (reactivity), functionality, stability, use and reactions with other specific food additives are reviewed. Where appropriate, the importance of interactions of food additives with other components of food (i.e. nutrients and non-nutrients) has been assessed and certain aspects of toxicology included. The practical outcome of this review is presented as a set of recommendations for future research in this area. The use of the data in this review is proposed as a training set to develop the framework into a diagnostic tool. This might be used ultimately for the development of a multilevel framework, operating systematically, to understand the important parameters that dictate the outcome of additive interactions.",p
"Carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in model systems and cooked foods: a review on formation, occurrence and intake.","Frying or grilling of meat and fish products may generate low ppb levels of mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HAs). Many heterocyclic amines are formed via the Maillard reaction from creatine, free amino acids and monosaccharides; compounds naturally occurring in protein-rich foods of animal origin. The formation and yield of HAs are dependent on physical parameters, such as cooking temperature and time, cooking technique and equipment, heat and mass transport, and on chemical parameters, especially the precursors to HAs. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the formation of HAs in cooked foods and model systems, and summarizes data on the content of HAs in various cooked foods, and estimates of the dietary intake of HAs. It should be noted that the presence of carcinogens of other types in food (e.g. nitrosamines, aromatic amines, cholesterol oxide products) and that their generation during frying and grilling are outside the scope of this review.",p
The use of immobilized enzymes in the food industry: a review.,"The production of high fructose corn syrups was greatly facilitated by the use of immobilized glucose isomerase. Similarly, in Japan, the fermentation industry proved its processing efficiency for amino acids through the use of immobilized amino acid acylase. This article discusses the use of soluble enzymes in the food industry followed by a section on the various available methods to immobilize enzymes. Once enzymes are immobilized, many of their operational parameters could be altered. Rationale for the determination of the effects of immobilization is provided. A relatively new concept is the use of a single matrix for immobilizing more than one enzyme. Immobilized multi-enzyme systems offer many attractive advantages; however, such a process also raises some interesting questions about kinetics. These questions and their suggested answers are discussed in the penultimate section. The major emphasis of this article is on the use of immobilized enzymes in the food industry. Two systems--amino acylase and glucose isomerase--have been demonstrated to be techno-economically feasible. Immobilization of other enzymes, such as glucoamylase, lactase, protease, and flavor modifying enzymes, has received some attention. The potential of these new systems are also discussed.",p
Electromagnetic energy and food processing.,"The use of electromagnetic energy in food processing is reviewed with respect to food safety, nutritional quality, and organoleptic quality. The effects of nonionizing radiation sources such as microwave and radio-frequency energy and ionizing radiation sources, e.g. radioactive cobalt-60 and caesium-137, on the inactivation of microbes and nutrients are compared with those of conventional heating processes both in terms of their kinetic behavior and their mechanisms of interaction with foods. The kinetics of microwave and conventional thermal inactivation are considered for a generalized nth-order model based on time and temperature conditions. However, thermal inactivation effects are often modeled by 1st-order kinetics. Microbial and nutrient inactivation by ionizing sources are considered for a 1st-order model based on radiation dose. Both thermal and radiation resistance concepts are reviewed and some typical values of radiation resistance are given for sensitive vegetative bacterial cells, yeasts, and molds and for resistant bacterial spores and viruses. Nonionizing microwave energy sources are increasingly used in home and industrial food processing and are well-accepted by the American public. But, despite recent Food and Drug Administration approval of low and intermediate ionizing radiation dose levels for grains and other plants products and the fact that irradiated foods are sold in more than 20 countries of the world, public fears in the U.S. about nuclear energy may limit the role of ionizing radiation in food processing and preservation and may also limit the use of nuclear fuels as an alternate source of electrical energy.",p

Regulatory approvals of pediatric oncology drugs: previous experience and new initiatives.,"PURPOSE
To review the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experience with approvals of new drugs for pediatric oncology and to discuss new regulatory initiatives directed at pediatric oncology.


METHODS
A retrospective review of FDA archival documents and the published literature.


RESULTS
More than 100 drugs have been approved by the Division of Oncology Drug Products of the FDA for the treatment of malignancies. Only 15 have pediatric use information in their labeling, which is less than 50% of the drugs commonly used in the treatment of pediatric malignancies. In the past 20 years, there have been six submissions to the FDA for pediatric oncology indications. To illustrate principles of the approval process, each submission is discussed.


CONCLUSION
Potential reasons for a lack of New Drug Application submissions for pediatric oncology include the small pediatric oncology market compared with the adult oncology market and perceived barriers to performing studies in children. Reasons for failure to approve pediatric indications include small numbers of patients, lack of appropriate controls, and failure to demonstrate patient benefit. Approval criteria include the use of controlled trials, prospective data collection, and disease-appropriate end points. Regulatory initiatives to promote pediatric therapeutic development and product labeling are discussed.",p
Investigation of outbreaks of salmonella in hospitals.,"In a two year prospective survey of outbreaks of salmonella infection in hospitals in England and Wales 55 outbreaks were identified. Reports of investigation of these outbreaks were reviewed for evidence of food borne infection and cross infection. Food borne infection probably accounted for only six outbreaks, but these made up 40% of the 15 outbreaks in which there were more than five patients and staff with symptoms. Person to person transmission was the probable mode of spread in most outbreaks. It is recommended that in addition to bacteriological investigations clinical and epidemiological data should be collected to implicate food or other possible common vehicles of infection. Bacteriological screening of patients and staff who do not have symptoms may be unrewarding in the absence of epidemiological data to define groups at risk of infection.",p
Drug interactions in the elderly.,"Polypharmacy and its dangers in the elderly are of increasing concern. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of drug with drug, drug with food, and drug with alcohol interactions in a population aged 60 years or greater. Four hundred patients were randomly selected from a university family medicine outpatient clinic population of 4,483 in this age group. A total of 292 drugs were involved for a total of 1,052 potential interactions: 310 drug-food, 316 drug-alcohol, and 426 drug-drug. Interactions were analyzed using The Drug Master computer program and rated as to their clinical significance. Chart review revealed no serious actual interaction for any patient even though potential interactions could be categorized as highly significant for 27 percent of the drug-drug, 11 percent of the drug-alcohol, and 3 percent of the drug-food. Thirty-two percent of the total population were taking five or more drugs concurrently. The mean number of drugs for men was 3.75 and for women 4.22 (P less than .05). Age and race differences were also noted in the number of drugs taken. The most common drugs and their interactions with drug, food, and alcohol are reviewed.",p
"Properties of low-fat, low-cholesterol egg yolk prepared by supercritical CO2 extraction.","A dry egg yolk ingredient called Eggcellent has 74% less fat and 90% less cholesterol than liquid egg yolks, when reconstituted on an equal protein basis. The phospholipids and proteins are retained, enabling the ingredient to have the taste and texturizing properties of fresh egg yolk. Using the new yolk, it is possible to significantly improve the acceptability of low-fat, low-cholesterol bakery products, scrambled eggs and mayonnaise dressings without losing nutritional claims. The structures and functional properties of egg yolk components and the conditions required to optimize their benefits in foods are reviewed. The lipoproteins of low-fat, low-cholesterol yolk have valuable properties as flavorants, texturizers, foaming agents, emulsifiers, antioxidants, colorants, and nutraceuticals.",p
"Capsicum--production, technology, chemistry, and quality--Part II. Processed products, standards, world production and trade.","Capsicums, as a spice, have been known since the beginning of civilization and historically associated with the discovery of the New World. The genus Capsicum (Fam. Solanaceae) provides many varieties and adds color, pungency, and aroma to the cuisines of most of the world. From the pungent chilli, of interest also to pharmaceuticals, to the colorful paprika and the bell capsicums with its remarkable aroma, the genus has been of great interest for its chemistry and physiological action. Pungency as a sensory attribute, its evaluation, structure-activity relationship, and its increasing acceptance and preference by diverse populations of the world are of great interest to many research disciplines. In a comprehensive review of all aspects in four sequential parts, Part I deals with History, Botany, Cultivation, and Primary Processing (CRC Critical Review, Food Science and Nutrition). The Capsicums among the spices are second only to black pepper in trades both in volume and value. The production of the different forms of this spice as ground, specialty seasonings, and as the concentrated oleoresins through technologically advanced processes, proposed newer products, the standard to control quality of the different products, world production, trade, and prospects are reviewed in detail in this, Part II.",p
Inhibition of browning by sulfites.,"The present state of understanding of the mechanisms by which sulfites inhibit browning reactions in food is reviewed. The difficulties of specifying the composition of sulfur(IV) oxospecies in sulfited foods arise from the existence of labile equilibria between SO2, HSO3-, SO3(2-) and S2O5(2-), whose position depends on concentration, ionic strength and the presence of non-electrolytes. A proportion of the additive is also found in a reversibly bound form. The main reason why sulfites are able to inhibit a wide range of browning reactions is the nucleophilic reactivity of sulfite ion. The mechanism of reactions between sulfite species and intermediates in the model Maillard browning reaction, glucose + glycine, are considered in depth and are supported by kinetic data. A most interesting feature is the fact that sulfites seem to catalyse the reactions they are added to control. Reaction products include 3,4-dideoxy-4-sulfohexosulose which is formed initially and polymeric substances arise from the reaction of sulfite species with melanoidins. It is found that melanoidins from glucose + glycine react with sulfite to such an extent that one sulfur atom is incorporated for every two glucose molecules used to make up the polymer. The mechanisms of inhibition of ascorbic acid browning, enzymic browning and lipid browning are reviewed briefly. The known toxicological consequences of the formation of reaction products when sulfites are used for the control of Maillard browning give little cause for concern. Little is known of the implications of the formation of reaction products during the inhibition of other forms of browning. Consideration of the requirements for alternatives to sulfites is given.",p
The application of in vitro data in the derivation of the acceptable daily intake of food additives.,"The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for food additives is commonly derived from the NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) in long-term animal in vivo studies. To derive an ADI a safety or uncertainty factor (commonly 100) is applied to the NOAEL in the most sensitive test species. The 100-fold safety factor is considered to be the product of both species and inter-individual differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. Although in vitro data have previously been considered during the risk assessment of food additives, they have generally had no direct influence on the calculation of ADI values. In this review 18 food additives are evaluated for the availability of in vitro toxicity data which might be used for the derivation of a specific data-derived uncertainty factor. For the majority of the food additives reviewed, additional in vitro tests have been conducted which supplement and support the short- and long-term in vivo toxicity studies. However, it was recognized that these in vitro studies could not be used in isolation to derive an ADI; only when sufficient in vivo mechanistic data are available can such information be used in a regulatory context. Additional short-term studies are proposed for the food additives which, if conducted, would provide data that could then be used for the calculation of data-derived uncertainty factors.",p

"Annual update: drugs, diagnostics and devices.","As NPs continue to play an important role in health care as administers of prescriptions, the value of reviewing the latest Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for new drugs and devices is immeasurable. In 2002, the FDA approved several new drugs and devices, as well as monitored previously approved drugs for adverse reactions and untoward events. This article provides a brief review of relevant primary care topics.",p
The migration from the internal coatings of food cans; summary of the findings and call for more effective regulation of polymers in contact with foods: a review.,"The analysis of migrates from the internal coatings of food cans showed that the present regulation is not sufficient to ensure safety of food contact polymers. The migrates often consist of complex mixtures of reaction products and impurities, and their harmlessness cannot be deduced from the use of non-toxic starting substances compiled in positive lists. The regulation proposed herein asks producers to analyse the composition of the migrates. It includes an upper limit for the molecular weight (e.g. 1000 Da) and thresholds defining concentrations in the foods down to which components must be identified and evaluated. Primarily considering feasibility at reasonable costs, thresholds of 30 micrograms/kg for individual components and 300 micrograms/kg for the sum of the unidentified materials are proposed. Producers must be able to demonstrate that the individual components or mixtures exceeding this limit, including reaction products with food components, have no toxic effect.",p
Modulation of globular protein functionality by weakly interacting cosolvents.,"Globular proteins are utilized in food, pharmaceutical, and health-care products because of their unique functional attributes, for example, enzyme catalysis, ligand binding and transport, surface activity and self-association. The expression of these functional attributes in a particular product depends on the molecular structure, chemical environment and thermal-mechanical history of the proteins. The optimization of the design and operation of processing technologies used to manufacture protein-containing materials depends on a thorough understanding of the influence of processing conditions and material composition on protein properties. This paper focuses on the impact of weakly interacting neutral cosolvents (such as sugars and polyols) on the structural, thermodynamic and functional properties of globular proteins in foods. The physicochemical mechanisms by which these cosolvents can modulate protein functionality are highlighted, that is, differential interactions and steric exclusion. Previous studies of the impact of cosolvents on protein functionality that are relevant to foods are reviewed, for example, water solubility, stabilization, emulsification, foaming, gelation, enzyme catalysis, and flavor binding.",p
Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of dysphagia to identify silent aspiration.,"The traditional bedside dysphagia evaluation has not been able to identify silent aspiration because the pharyngeal phase of swallowing could not be objectively assessed. To date, only videofluoroscopy has been used to detect silent aspiration. This investigation assessed the aspiration status of 400 consecutive, at risk subjects by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Our study demonstrated that 175 of 400 (44%) subjects were without aspiration, 115 of 400 (29%) exhibited aspiration with a cough reflex, and 110 of 400 (28%) aspirated silently. No significant differences were observed for age or gender and aspiration status. The FEES, done at bedside, avoids irradiation exposure, is repeatable as often as necessary, uses regular food, can be videotaped for review, and is a patient-friendly method of identifying silent aspiration.",p
Evaluation of the integrated time-temperature effect in thermal processing of foods.,"In this review, current methods used to evaluate the integrated impact of time and temperature upon preserving a food product by a heat treatment are considered. After identifying the basic premise any preservation scheme shall meet, the central role of a feasible description for the heat activation kinetics of microorganisms, their spores, and other quality attributes are stressed. Common concepts to quantify a thermal process are presented. Shortcomings of the prevalent evaluation methods are highlighted and attention is given to the development, restrictions, and possibilities of time-temperature-integrators as ""new"" evaluation tools to measure the impact of a ""classical"" in-pack heat treatment and more modern heating techniques such as continuous processing of solid/liquid mixtures on foods.",p
Gastrointestinal factors in hunger and satiety.,"The evidence for the participation of signals from the gastrointestinal tract in hunger and satiety is reviewed. Various methods of subjecting only certain portions of the gastrointestinal tract to food are described including sham feeding, crossing of the intestines of two animals, and intragastric, intraduodenal and intravenous feeding. These methods have revealed that animals eat more when only the mouth is exposed to food, but consume less when food enters the stomach directly and still less when feeding themselves intravenously. The role of the stomach in satiety is discussed in relation to the results of the many experiments in which intragastric loads were administered. These experiments generally revealed that gastric loads suppressed intake in proportion to their caloric value, but that compensation was not precise. A similar analysis is made of the role of the intestines in satiety. These studies present evidence for osmoreceptors and glucoreceptors, distention, and pressure, all of which may participate in satiety. The numerous effects of vagotomy on food intake are reviewed and an attempt is made to separate afferent from efferent effects and vagal effects from nonspecific surgical injury. The role of other afferents is explored. A brief survey of the most recent studies on humoral factors indicates that cholecystokinin is probably acting as a satiety agent, but its mode of action remains unknown. The changes in the gastrointestinal tract that accompany an increase or decrease in food intake reveal adaptive changes that occur in the organ. The evidence for gastrointestinal factors in satiety of the suckling animal is presented. Finally, a hypothesis is presented in which the various factors that bring a meal to an end are included. Preabsorptive satiety may consist of multiple factors which probably include signals from osmoreceptors and possibly other chemoreceptors in the upper small intestine. The signals from these receptors are neural while other products of digestion stimulate the release of humoral agents, such as cholecystokinin, which may act locally, in the liver, or on the central nervous system. Stretch or distention of the intestines at various locations may also contribute to preabsorptive satiety.",p
Nutritional requirements in cystic fibrosis: a review.,"Food intake is often low in cystic fibrosis (CF), although the patient usually needs more than the standard recommended daily allowance (RDA). Clinics giving food supplementation from an early age report improved survival and nutritional status. Nutritional improvement has been facilitated by improved forms of pancreatin. An additional calorie intake in CF is required to compensate for losses due to malabsorption and to allow for catch-up growth when necessary. With advanced pulmonary disease there are additional requirements for infection and increased work of breathing. There is also evidence for an increased basal metabolic activity in CF, perhaps related to the fundamental intracellular biochemical disorder. Together these factors add to a daily need for 120%-150% RDA for optimum growth and homeostasis.",p
Recent activities of public agencies to assure healthful diets for Americans.,"In the United States, public agencies long have been involved in providing information about food and nutrition. Over the years, however, the nature of that involvement has shifted. Initially the emphasis was on practical information about agriculture and home economics. Gradually emphasis has shifted to concerns about malnutrition and, more recently, to concerns about overconsumption and associated health problems. This paper reviews some of the food and nutrition-related activities of public agencies and summarizes some recent concerns related to nutrition ""recommendations"", ""goals"", and ""guidelines"". Two key publications related to nutrition issues are: 1) ""Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,"" published jointly by United States Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services and 2) ""Toward Healthful Diets,"" from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. One of the guidelines in the former publication tends to encourage the dairy industry to orient toward reducing consumption of milk fat. In contrast, the analysis in the latter publication tends to encourage adoption of an approach to promote nutrition education and marketing programs without necessarily reducing consumption of milk fat. The approach of dairy industry would differ depending upon which guidelines were adopted.",p
Anti-nutritional and toxic factors in food legumes: a review.,"A comprehensive review on the presence of certain important anti-nutritional and toxic factors in food legumes has been conducted. These substances include proteolytic inhibitors, phytohemagglutinins, lathyrogens, cyanogenetic compounds, compounds causing favism, factors affecting digestibility and saponins. These factors are shown to be widely present in leguminous foods which are important constituents of the diet of a large section of the world's population, and particularly, of people in the developing countries.",p
Epidemiology and diagnosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections.,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have been identified as a worldwide cause of serious human gastrointestinal disease and the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. The most common serotype implicated is E. coli O157: H7, but infections involving various non-O157 serotypes have been found with increasing frequency in many countries. Food-borne outbreaks caused by STEC can affect large numbers of people and cause serious morbidity, making the bacteria one of the most important emerging pathogens. Because there is no specific treatment of the disease currently available, there is an urgent need for effective preventive measures based on a detailed understanding of the epidemiology of STEC infections. Such measures will also be dependent on the availability of rapid, sensitive, and simple procedures for the detection of the pathogens both in human samples and in samples of nonhuman origin such as food. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the epidemiology of STEC infection and presents a survey of laboratory methods currently available for diagnosis of STEC. Special attention is given to new diagnostic procedures for the less readily detectable non-O157 STEC strains and to simple procedures, usually based on commercially available kits, that can be used in routine clinical microbiological laboratories.",p
Pulsed electric field processing of foods: a review.,"Use of pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for inactivation of microorganisms is one of the more promising nonthermal processing methods. Inactivation of microorganisms exposed to high-voltage PEFs is related to the electromechanical instability of the cell membrane. Electric field strength and treatment time are the two most important factors involved in PEF processing. Encouraging results are reported at the laboratory level, but scaling up to the industrial level escalates the cost of the command charging power supply and of the high-speed electrical switch. In this paper, we critically review the results of earlier experimental studies on PEFs and we suggest the future work that is required in this field. Inactivation tests in viscous foods and in liquid food containing particulates must be conducted. A successful continuous PEF processing system for industrial applications has yet to be designed. The high initial cost of setting up the PEF processing system is the major obstacle confronting those who would encourage the system's industrial application. Innovative developments in high-voltage pulse technology will reduce the cost of pulse generation and will make PEF processing competitive with thermal-processing methods.",p
The thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reaction in foods: a review.,"The wide diffusion of 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in the scientific literature is due to the TBA assay, or TBA test, which has been employed in the determination of autoxidative alterations of fats and oils. Two processes occur in autoxidation, generally: the free radical and the photo-oxidation mechanisms. The better studied is the free radical mechanism. The hydroperoxiepidioxides and bicycloendoperoxides are malonaldehyde (MDA) precursors. The absorption spectrum obtained with oxidized fatty foods is like the spectrum obtained when TBA and MDA react. However, during the secondary phase of the autoxidation process other aldehydes (alkanals, 2-alkenals, dienals) are formed which react with TBA, and they are responsible for off-flavors. Three kinds of pigments (yellow, orange, red adducts) are involved. Also, aromatic aldehydes, which constitute the flavor profile of diverse fruits and essential oils, form with TBA the characteristic arylidene-2-TBA acids. Other substances, such as ketones, ketosteroids, acids, esters, sugars, imides and amides, amino acids, oxidized proteins, pyridines, pyrimidines, and vitamins can react with TBA; they are named TBARS (substances that react with TBA), and form principally in meats and meat derivatives. Several organic or bio-organic acids, as shikimic and sorbic acids, react photometrically with TBA if a Malaprade reaction takes place before. A structural study of the red adduct TBA-MDA has been carried out.",p
"Diagnosis of invasive cervical carcinoma with fluid-based, thin-layer slide preparation method.","Objectives: Although the main role of the Papanicolaou smear is to detect precursors of cervical cancer, the detection of invasive disease is important to identify women at the earliest stage of their disease. This study assesses the ability of the ThinPrep Papanicolaou test to identify invasive cervical cancer as compared to the Papanicolaou smear.Methods: A meta-analysis of five studies previously reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration was performed. There were 61 cases of cervical carcinoma processed by both conventional Papanicolaou smear and ThinPrep methods. Each case was reviewed by cytotechnologists and cytopathologists without knowledge of prior diagnoses. In a sub-study, the filtrate resulting from the preparation of the ThinPrep was analyzed to determine if diagnostic cells passed through the filter membrane.Results: With the ThinPrep method, a diagnosis of cancer was made in 54 cases (88.5%) as compared to a diagnosis of cancer in 52 of these cases with the conventional Papanicolaou smear method (85.2%). In those cases where diagnosis of invasive cancer was not made with the ThinPrep method, all cases were classified as abnormal, ranging from atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The ThinPrep slides contained tumor diathesis and other contextual clues. Analysis of the ThinPrep filtrate demonstrated that cancer cells did not pass through the filter.Conclusions: These studies indicate that the ThinPrep method is at least equivalent to the conventional Papanicolaou smear method for the demonstration of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and other cervical malignancies. Diagnostically important cells are not lost through the filter membrane during the preparation of the ThinPrep slide, because they are larger than the 8 µm pore size of the filter.",p
Possible asbestos hazards in clinical allergy.,"The potential hazards of biological products contaminated by asbestos fibers are quite properly being reviewed by the food and pharmaceutical industries. We have demonstrated that glycerinated saline solutions can be contaminated with asbestos fibers under certain conditions of simulated clinical use of asbestos-packed syringes. Because the fibrogenic and carcinogenic effects of asbestos are subtle and may not be manifest for a long latent period, the future use of asbestos containing materials in allergy practice might be more harmful than now realized.",p
Principles of pediatric combination vaccines and practical issues related to use in clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND
During the past two decades the number of injections that are required per office visit to fulfill the recommended childhood immunization schedule has increased dramatically.


METHODS
By reviewing the literature, the principles associated with pediatric combination vaccines are discussed, and practical issues related to their use in clinical practice are evaluated.


RESULTS
The ideal combination vaccine is safe, effective and easy to store and use, and its antigenic components fit within the recommended immunization schedule. The ideal combination is associated with fewer adverse reactions than the separately administered antigens, with improved efficacy and higher immune responses compared with its component vaccines. An acceptable combination vaccine must provide comparable efficacy and safety to its component vaccines. Although there are a limited number of combination vaccines already available [diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and measles-mumps-rubella], effort is being focused on combining these vaccines with other routine vaccines of infancy including Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). Currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration are diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTPa)-HepB-IPV and DTPa-Hib-IPV combination vaccines, and two DTPa-HepB-IPV-Hib vaccines have been licensed in Europe. As more combination vaccines become available, issues such as interchangeability and administration of extra doses are raised; however, it is important not to miss a vaccination opportunity.


CONCLUSIONS
The number of injections required to fulfill the recommended childhood immunization schedule at each visit creates problems for patients and practitioner, sometimes risking a missed opportunity for vaccination. The development of combination vaccines will circumvent this problem and increase compliance and vaccination coverage rates.",p
"The ""P's and Q's"" of quality systems.","Quality improvement in blood collection centers has been a priority of regulatory and accrediting agencies for the past several years. The Food and Drug Administration and the American Association of Blood Banks have developed guidelines for quality assurance activities. Inspection programs have focused on evaluation of processes and how they are controlled to assure the safety and efficacy of blood components. A review of Food and Drug Administration enforcement actions shows that all such actions cite similar deficiencies related to management control, personnel training, error, and record management policies. A quality program that includes management commitment to compliance and continuous improvement, defined personnel training, internal audit, and error management policies provides documented evidence to management and regulatory agencies that operations are in control.",p
Preparation and use of reference materials for quality assurance in inorganic trace analysis.,"A general preparation and certification scheme used in the Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology (INCT) for the preparation and use of certified reference materials (CRMs) for inorganic trace analysis is presented and contrasted with approaches used by other CRM producers. 'Definitive' and 'very accurate' methods have a role, based on a combination of neutron activation and quantitative and selective post-irradiation isolation of an indicator radionuclide by column chromatography. Natural matrix CRMs of biological origin including the typical food products are reviewed and the need is identified for new well-characterized materials that would also be suitable for micro-analytical techniques such as PIXE, EDXRF, SS-AAS, etc. There are various approaches to studying homogeneity and its relationship with particle size distribution of a material, and the many problems associated with reliable particle size measurements of CRMs by various techniques are illustrated using real examples. There is an equation relating Ingamells' sampling constant to the mass of single particle of a powder material and this theoretical approach has been compared with experimental results obtained for some CRMs.",p
A critical review of food fiber analysis and data.,"Epidemiologists, research scientists, and dietitians need data on the dietary fiber content of foods. This article provides a provisional table on dietary fiber, compiled after a thorough search of the literature and a critical evaluation of the analytical methodology employed. To make fully understandable the limitations and problems associated with the current dietary fiber data base, a short review of what is meant by the term dietary fiber and the complex chemical structures of the major dietary fibers--cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin--are presented. A short description of the numerous analytical methods for quantifying dietary fiber, including the neutral detergent fiber procedure, the various enzymatic gravimetric procedures, and the analytic schemes for measuring the major dietary fiber fractions is also given, along with the strengths and weakness of the various procedures. The table on foods commonly eaten in the United States is meant as an interim guide for menu planning and dietary evaluation until newer data become available. Data are most limited on legumes and the numerous specialty baked products and breads available in this country.",p
Contemporary food technology and its impact on cuisine.,"This article contains a general review of current food technologies and their effect on the quality and safety of foods. The uses of these technologies in the context of current and projected world population, urbanization prevention of food losses, preservation and trade of foods, domestically and internationally are briefly reviewed. Technologies discussed are related to food storage, refrigeration, frozen foods, milling and baking, canning, pickling, extrusion processes, fermentation, and to foods and food ingredients such as fruits and vegetables, animal products, fat and oils, canned products, and food additives.",p
Liquid chromatographic separation of terpenoid pigments in foods and food products.,The newest achievements in the use of various liquid chromatographic techniques such as adsorption and reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography and HPLC employed for the separation and quantitative determination of terpenoid-based color substances in foods and food products are reviewed. The techniques applied for the analysis of individual pigments and pigments classes are surveyed and critically evaluated. Future trends in the separation and identification of pigments in foods and food products are delineated.,p
Carcinogens and mutagens that may occur in foods.,"The principal carcinogens and mutagens that have been identified in human foods are reviewed. These agents may occur in foods as naturally occurring components (e.g., metabolites made by plant or fungal cells), components of contaminating plants or microorganisms, food additives (usually unintentional), or products that arise during processing or cooking. In the mixed diets of developed countries the levels of the known carcinogens and mutagens are very low. However, serious contamination of foods by the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 has occurred in some parts of the world; contamination by N-nitroso compounds or their precursors is another important concern. Extrapolation of the data on the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of chemicals that can occur in foods to an accurate estimation of the potential hazard to human populations is not yet possible.",p
Partition coefficients in food/packaging systems: a review.,"Food contamination can result from various interactions between food and packaging materials. Migration of volatiles, additives, monomers and oligomers from packaging materials into food or adsorption of volatile compounds from the food by the polymer are important considerations from safety, hygienic and economic points of view. The term 'migration' includes two phenomena (partition and diffusion) that can be important in determining the concentration of contaminants in a food system at any time. An estimation of the partition coefficient, K, in food/packaging systems has been the major objective of numerous different studies. Various parameters can influence K such as temperature, pH, the chemical structure of the migrant, molecular size and structure, fat content, and degrees of crystallinity. Some theoretical approaches such as the quantitative structure-property relationship method could be of interest in the near future.",p
Quantifying recontamination through factory environments--a review.,"Recontamination of food products can be the origin of foodborne illnesses and should therefore be included in quantitative microbial risk assessment (MRA) studies. In order to do this, recontamination should be quantified using predictive models. This paper gives an overview of the relevant modelling approaches that are available in the literature to quantify recontamination via factory environment. Different recontamination routes are described: recontamination via air, via processing equipment or via hand contact. Unfortunately, not many available models are directly applicable to the food industry; most models are developed for aquatic or environmental systems. Finally, a general systematic approach is proposed for modelling contamination from surfaces via air, hands or liquid into the product and ranges for the parameters are given.",p
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia. Review of the literature and Food and Drug Administration Adverse Drug Reaction reports.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to detail the clinical and pathologic presentation of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia (PIE) associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.


METHODS
We reviewed case reports and Food and Drug Administration Adverse Drug Reaction Spontaneous Reporting Program reports.


RESULTS
A case of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia related to naproxen use was studied. Six similar cases from the medical literature and 22 reports from the Food and Drug Administration were reviewed. Four cases of PIE associated with ibuprofen, obtained from the Food and Drug Administration, and single literature reports of PIE associated with fenoprofen and sulindac detailed similar clinical presentations. The clinical presentation of PIE syndrome associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs included fever, cough, dyspnea, infiltrates on chest roentgenogram, and an absolute peripheral eosinophilia. Pathologic examination revealed poorly defined granulomas with infiltrating eosinophils.


CONCLUSIONS
Naproxen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can elicit the PIE syndrome. The prevalence of this side effect is likely underestimated, given the extensive use of these drugs and the relatively benign course of PIE syndrome.",p
"Aflatoxins in food: occurrence, biosynthesis, effects on organisms, detection, and methods of control.","Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by species of Aspergilli, specifically Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. These molds are ubiquitous in nature and grow on a variety of substrates, thereby producing aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are of great concern due to their biochemical and biological effects on living organisms. In this article, the occurrence of aflatoxins, their biosynthesis, factors influencing their production, their effects on living organisms, and methods of detection and control in food are reviewed. Future areas of research involving mathematical modeling of factors influencing aflatoxin production and alternative methods of control, such as modified atmosphere packaging, are also discussed.",p
P & T committee review of misoprostol: prevention of NSAID side effects is key--roundtable discussion.,"Misoprostol, a prostaglandin of the E series, was recently introduced for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Misoprostol was classified as ""1A"" (denoting a new chemical entity that is a significant therapeutic advance) for purposes of review priority by the Food and Drug Administration in 1988. A dosage of 200 micrograms qid is recommended for prophylaxis, for the duration of NSAID therapy. Misoprostol is generally well-tolerated, with some patients reporting diarrhea. Misoprostol should not be given to pregnant women because of its uterotonic effects. (Please see full prescribing information for a discussion of the safety profile of misoprostol.) Because of the magnitude of the problem of NSAID-induced gastric ulceration and the expense of treatments and hospitalizations, the use of misoprostol in preventing these ulcers should be clinically beneficial, and may contribute to significant cost savings in the hospital and other managed-care settings.",p
"Nitrates, nitrites and N-nitrosocompounds: a review of the occurrence in food and diet and the toxicological implications.","Data on occurrence of nitrate, nitrite and N-nitrosocompounds in food and drinking water, and on total dietary intakes are reviewed. Metabolic, toxicological and epidemiological studies are surveyed and the implications with respect to safety evaluation are addressed. It is concluded that, on the basis of recent long-term animal studies and of clinical experience in man, the current Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) allocated to nitrate by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives of 0-5 mg/kg body weight/day (expressed as sodium nitrate) might be increased to 0-25 mg/kg body weight/day. Based on similar criteria, the ADI for nitrite would be 0-0.1 mg/kg body weight/day (expressed as sodium nitrite). In view of the known carcinogenicity of N-nitrosocompounds, exposure to these compounds in food should be minimized by appropriate technological means, such as lowering the nitrite concentration in preserved foods to the minimum required to ensure microbiological safety and use of inhibitors of nitrosation like alpha-tocopherol or ascorbic acid. Further work is needed to define the minimal levels of nitrite in foods needed to inhibit outgrowth of Clostridium botulinum and toxin production.",p
Liver involvement in the sulfone syndrome.,"A patient being treated with dapsone developed a hypersensitivity reaction with typical features of the ""sulfone syndrome,"" including fever, malalse, and hepatitis. All abnormalities rapidly reversed with discontinuance of the dapsone regimen and institution of prednisone therapy. Hepatic involvement may be a prominent feature of the sulfone syndrome and may be of the hepatocellular or cholestatic type. Based on our review of the Food and Drug Administration reports, this syndrome appears to be relatively uncommon, but physicians need to recognize that expression of this syndrome may be incomplete. More clinical data are necessary to better define the incidence and pathogenesis of sulfone-induced liver disease.",p
Understanding external controls over the commercial introduction of engineered human tissues. Assessing regulatory and liability issues.,"Emerging biomedical technologies present a new order of magnitude of complexity in their interactions with human patients. As such, they challenge established processes for protecting patients and the public health, while testing the capacity of those processes to ensure timely access to beneficial therapies--especially those representing significant advances over existing therapies. This article reviews the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory process--including the classification of medical products, the marketing review and approval pathways, and the 1997 FDA Modernization Act--and discusses other legal and policy considerations relevant to engineered tissues.",p
Can science give us the tools for recognizing possible health risks of GM food?,"Nearly ten years after the introduction of GM foodcrops there are still only a handful of published studies about their safety. Independent studies are even fewer, moreover, no peer-reviewed publications exist in which the results of clinical investigations on the possible effects of GM food on human health are described. Even though the evaluation of the safety or possible toxicity of GM foodstuffs is more difficult than that of drugs or food additives, this scarcity of data and the lack of a scientific database is curious particularly as descriptions of the results of chemical, nutritional and biological testing in some early (unpublished) studies or some more recent publications demonstrate the feasibility of carrying out proper and scientifically valid health risk assessment on GM foods. In this review, after critically examining some of the basic principles, past results and possible novel methods of future health safety assessment of GM foodstuffs, the conclusion appears to be that as the tools for the recognition and indeed for the elimination of the risks GM foods may present for us are available or can be developed, it is the will and the funding for such work that needs to be found.",p
Food interactions with sustained-release theophylline preparations. A review.,"Currently, theophylline is being used predominantly as sustained-release capsules or tablets. In the mid-seventies the first preparations for use with a dosage interval of 12 hours (twice-daily preparations) were introduced. Since 1983, theophylline preparations that can be given with an interval of 24 hours (once-daily preparations) have become available. The release of theophylline from some of these products can be influenced (either increased or decreased) by concomitant intake of food. With some preparations the composition of the meal (especially the fat content) has an influence on the degree of effect. The consequence may be an effect on the rate of absorption or on the amount absorbed, or both simultaneously. This could result in an unexpected shift of the plasma theophylline concentration. Such a shift is therapeutically undesirable, because theophylline has a fairly narrow therapeutic range. A review is given of those food interactions with the sustained-release theophylline preparations, both twice-daily and once-daily products, that are currently on the world market. Special attention is paid to the specific (bio)pharmaceutical characteristics of the different products, and to the influence of the composition and timing of the meals. For each preparation the effect of food on the following pharmacokinetic parameters is discussed: area under the plasma concentration-time curve, peak plasma drug concentration and time to reach this peak. Where possible, the results for both adults and children are discussed. There are indications that children are more susceptible to food-effects than adults. The regulatory aspects are mentioned briefly. Clinically important effects of food have been observed with the following twice-daily products: 'Theo-Dur Sprinkle', 'Theolair SR' (= 'Nuelin SR') and 'Theograd'. Pronounced effects could have an even greater impact with once-daily preparations, as the total daily dose will be given at a single time. A particularly sudden release of a major part of the dose ('dose-dumping') may result in toxic plasma concentrations. Among these products, clinically important effects in children have been reported with 'Theo-24' and 'Uniphyl'.",p
Pharmacologic interventions in nuclear medicine assessment of cardiac perfusion.,"Drugs that are currently used for therapeutic purposes can also be used in diagnostic tests. This paper will review the use of such pharmacological interventions in cardiac assessment in Nuclear Medicine. To fully comprehend the effect of these drugs, a small review of diagnostic nuclear medicine as currently used to assess cardiac perfusion is included. This will allow pharmacists to understand the rationale behind the single administration of either vasodilator or inotropic agents and to review which drugs and food may interact with the test.",p
Encapsulation in the food industry: a review.,"Encapsulation involves the incorporation of food ingredients, enzymes, cells or other materials in small capsules. Applications for this technique have increased in the food industry since the encapsulated materials can be protected from moisture, heat or other extreme conditions, thus enhancing their stability and maintaining viability. Encapsulation in foods is also utilized to mask odours or tastes. Various techniques are employed to form the capsules, including spray drying, spray chilling or spray cooling, extrusion coating, fluidized bed coating, liposome entrapment, coacervation, inclusion complexation, centrifugal extrusion and rotational suspension separation. Each of these techniques is discussed in this review. A wide variety of foods is encapsulated--flavouring agents, acids bases, artificial sweeteners, colourants, preservatives, leavening agents, antioxidants, agents with undesirable flavours, odours and nutrients, among others. The use of encapsulation for sweeteners such as aspartame and flavours in chewing gum is well known. Fats, starches, dextrins, alginates, protein and lipid materials can be employed as encapsulating materials. Various methods exist to release the ingredients from the capsules. Release can be site-specific, stage-specific or signalled by changes in pH, temperature, irradiation or osmotic shock. In the food industry, the most common method is by solvent-activated release. The addition of water to dry beverages or cake mixes is an example. Liposomes have been applied in cheese-making, and its use in the preparation of food emulsions such as spreads, margarine and mayonnaise is a developing area. Most recent developments include the encapsulation of foods in the areas of controlled release, carrier materials, preparation methods and sweetener immobilization. New markets are being developed and current research is underway to reduce the high production costs and lack of food-grade materials.",p
Food allergy--fact or fiction: a review.,"Food sensitivity is a common condition presenting with various clinical syndromes including migraine, urticaria, gluten enteropathy, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. It is a heterogeneous condition affecting different organ systems and is also aetiologically diverse with subgroups due to allergy, pharmacological reactions, enzyme deficiencies and psychological causes. Clinical acceptance of food sensitivity has been delayed by the use of dubious diagnostic techniques by a minority of practitioners and the lack of laboratory diagnostic tests, but several double blind studies have now fully validated the existence of food sensitivity syndromes. More widespread recognition of food sensitivity would be cost effective for the National Health Service.",p
Interactions of isoniazid with foods.,"We reviewed reactions previously reported in patients treated with isoniazid, who ate certain fish and cheeses. We observed similar reactions in two patients after they ingested cheese and wine. Isoniazid is an inhibitor of both monoamine and diamine oxidases, which contribute to the metabolism of histamine that may be present in some fish and cheeses. Monoamine oxidase also acts in the metabolism of tyramine, present in some cheeses and wines. Reactions reported after eating fish or cheese, in patients treated with isoniazid, are similar in that both are characterized by headache, palpitations, skin flushing, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus. Reactions after fish have not been associated with increased blood pressure, whereas those following cheese ingestion frequently result in modest increases in blood pressure. Patients treated with isoniazid should be alerted to the possibility of reactions after eating certain foods.",p
An evaluation of the quinolone-theophylline interaction using the Food and Drug Administration spontaneous reporting system.,"A review of the Food and Drug Administration's spontaneous reporting system identified 48 reports of adverse events in patients who received concomitant therapy with ciprofloxacin (n = 39) or norfloxacin (n = 9) and theophylline. The mean (SD) age of these cases was 68.4 (18.5) years; 25 patients (52%) were female. The mean percent change in theophylline concentrations was 114%, with a range of 32% to 308% following the addition of a quinolone to the patient's theophylline regimen. Fourteen (36%) of the 39 patients receiving ciprofloxacin and three (33%) of the nine patients receiving norfloxacin experienced a seizure. The accumulated evidence suggests that extreme caution should be used when quinolones are prescribed in conjunction with theophylline, particularly in elderly patients. Further research is required to identify risk factors that will more specifically predict the magnitude of the interaction.",p
Eating frequency: methodological and dietary aspects.,"It is commonly stated that 'snack' foods provide 'empty calories' and, therefore elevate energy intake whilst providing insignificant quantities of other nutrients. The data presented in the present review suggest that foods which contribute to the pattern of 'snacking' contribute significantly to the nutrient quality of the diet. Those who 'snack' frequently tend to eat more food in general. Part of the difficulty in identifying the nutritional implications of 'snacking' is related to the definitions of 'meals' and 'snacks' and subsequent categorization of individual patterns. The physiological definitions typically relating to energy content or the time of eating do not necessarily coincide with colloquial, cultural or individual perceptions of what constitutes a 'meal' or 'snack'. Clearly, a more consistent approach would facilitate interpretation of the literature and enable more effective health education messages about 'snacking' to be delivered.",p
"Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy.","Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for >1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged <5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.",p
Variables influencing food perception reviewed for consumer-oriented product development.,"Consumer wishes have to be translated into product characteristics to implement consumer-oriented product development. Before this step can be made, insight in food-related behavior and perception of consumers is necessary to make the right, useful, and successful translation. Food choice behavior and consumers' perception are studied in many disciplines. Models of food behavior and preferences therefore were studied from a multidisciplinary perspective. Nearly all models structure the determinants related to the person, the food, and the environment. Consequently, the overview of models was used as a basis to structure the variables influencing food perception into a model for consumer-oriented product development. To this new model, referred to as food perception model, other variables like time and place as part of consumption moment were added. These are important variables influencing consumers' perception, and therefore of increasing importance to consumer-oriented product development nowadays. In further research, the presented food perception model is used as a tool to implement successful consumer-oriented product development.",p
Immobilized enzymes as tools in food analysis.,"A lot of publications described the possibilities of using selective enzymatic reactions in analysis, but not much authors described applications for the analysis of real samples. In this paper important publications, which described different applications in food analysis, are reviewed. In the first section the use of biosensors for food analysis, in the second section the combination of immobilized enzymes and flow injection analysis and in the last section the use of immobilized enzymes in combination with HPLC are described. Most of the applications described used enzymes for the determination of sugars mainly glucose, but also methods for the determination of inhibitors in foods are described.",p
Analysis of sterol oxidation products in foods.,"The main aspects related to the analysis of sterol oxidation products (SOP) in foods are comprehensively reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on the critical and controversial points of this analysis because these points affect crucial analytical parameters such as precision, accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity. The effect of sample preparation and the conditions of quantification by gas chromatography and liquid chromatography on these parameters are also reviewed. The results show that, in order to choose an adequate method to analyze SOP in a certain food, the analyst must consider its SOP concentration and matrix complexity. The term SOP includes both cholesterol oxidation products (COP) and phytosterol oxidation products (POP). The state of the art of COP and POP analysis is quite different; many more studies have dealt with the analysis of COP than of POP. However, most of the results presented here about COP analysis may be extrapolated to POP analysis because both groups of compounds show similar structures and characteristics.",p
"Nutrition, endothelial cell metabolism, and atherosclerosis.","The vascular endothelium that forms an interface between the blood and the surrounding tissues is continuously exposed to both physiologic and pathophysiologic stimuli. These stimuli are often mediated by nutrients that can contribute to the overall function of the endothelial cell in the regulation of vascular tone, coagulation and fibrinolysis, cellular growth and differentiation, and immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, nutrient-mediated functional changes of the endothelium and the underlying tissues may be significantly involved in the atherosclerotic disease process. There is evidence that individual nutrients or nutrient derivatives may either provoke or prevent metabolic and physiologic perturbations of the vascular endothelium. Preservation of nutrients that exhibit antiatherogenic properties may, therefore, be a critical issue in the preparation and processing of foods. This review focuses on selected nutrients as they affect endothelial cell metabolism and their possible implications in atherosclerosis.",p
Analytical methods used to measure acrylamide concentrations in foods.,"The state-of-the-art of analysis for acrylamide in food is reviewed. The majority of analytical methods adopts a similar approach: addition of internal standard to the specimen, extraction with water, purification of extract using a solid-phase extraction cartridge, and then determination using either gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) after bromination, or direct measurement with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (LC/MS). The available methods generally show good agreement and are likely to be accurate. However, improvements in precision (within-laboratory) and repeatability (between-laboratory) are needed by particular data users.",p
Metabisulfite sensitivity: case report and literature review.,Sulfiting agents have recently been identified as food and drug additives responsible for adverse reactions. These reactions are not rare and may result in life-threatening asthma and anaphylaxis. We report a 34-year-old female with intractable asthma and urticaria. Sensitivity to sulfites was suspected based on exacerbation after restaurant meals and metaproterenol 5% inhalant solution. Bronchial provocation challenge resulted in a 28% decrease in FEV1 and a 34% decrease in FEF25-75 at the 0.01 mg/ml dose. Thirty-two cases of sulfite sensitivity reported in the literature are reviewed. Foods and drugs containing sulfites are listed. The pathogenic mechanism is unknown. The FDA allows the addition of sulfites to foods and drugs without disclosure. Only recently has this potential hazard been recognized. The FDA is considering a labeling requirement on drugs that do contain sulfites.,p
World food trends and prospects to 2025.,"This paper reviews food (especially cereal) production trends and prospects for the world and its main regions. Despite fears to the contrary, in recent years we have seen continued progress toward better methods of feeding humanity. Sub-Saharan Africa is the sole major exception. Looking to the future, this paper argues that the continuation of recent cereal yield trends should be sufficient to cope with most of the demographically driven expansion of cereal demand that will occur until the year 2025. However, because of an increasing degree of mismatch between the expansion of regional demand and the potential for supply, there will be a major expansion of world cereal (and noncereal food) trade. Other consequences for global agriculture arising from demographic growth include the need to use water much more efficiently and an even greater dependence on nitrogen fertilizers (e.g., South Asia). Farming everywhere will depend more on information-intensive agricultural management procedures. Moreover, despite continued general progress, there still will be a significant number of undernourished people in 2025. Signs of heightened harvest variability, especially in North America, are of serious concern. Thus, although future general food trends are likely to be positive, in some respects we also could be entering a more volatile world.",p
Estimation of the dietary intake of chemicals in food.,"Methods for estimating the exposure of individuals to chemical substances present in the diet require information to be obtained about the patterns of food consumption in a community as well as the concentration of these chemicals in the diet. Methods of estimating food intakes using food diaries/weighed intake studies, dietary recall studies, food frequency and food disappearance methods are described. Their use, together with calculations derived from the data they provide are described to estimate normal and atypical food consumption patterns. The methods which have been used to estimate the exposure to existing chemicals in food are briefly reviewed and include total diet studies, selective studies on individual foods and duplicate portion studies. These methods are inappropriate for estimating the prospective intake of a chemical in food and the ways in which this issue may be approached, both nationally and internationally, are described with particular reference to the intakes of pesticide residues and food additives.",p
Risk of worsening renal function with nesiritide in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.,"BACKGROUND
Renal function is an important prognostic factor for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We investigated the renal effects of nesiritide as treatment for ADHF.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Randomized clinical trials comparing nesiritide with either placebo or active control for ADHF were identified by electronic and manual searches and thorough review of US Food and Drug Administration files available via the website. Worsening renal function was defined as an increase in serum creatinine >0.5 mg/dL. Relative risk across all studies was determined by meta-analysis with Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects models (RR(MH)). Risk of dialysis and medical intervention for worsening renal function were compared between therapies. Frequency of worsening renal function was determined from 5 randomized studies that included 1269 patients. Use of Food and Drug Administration-approved doses of nesiritide (< or =0.03 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) significantly increased the risk of worsening renal function compared with non-inotrope-based control (RR(MH), 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.00; P=0.003) or any control therapy, including non-inotrope- and inotrope-based therapies (RR(MH), 1.54; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.98; P=0.001). Even low-dose nesiritide (< or =0.015 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) significantly increased risk (P=0.012 and P=0.006 compared with non-inotrope- and inotrope-based controls, respectively), as did nesiritide administered at any dose up to 0.06 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). There was no difference in the need for dialysis between therapies.


CONCLUSIONS
Nesiritide significantly increases the risk of worsening renal function in patients with ADHF. Whether worsening renal function reflects hemodynamic effect or renal injury is unknown, but the prognostic importance of worsening renal function suggests the need for further investigation in appropriately powered clinical trials.",p
A review of the Food and Drug Administration risk analysis for polychlorinated biphenyls in fish.,"This paper reviews the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analysis of the risk to humans from consuming fish contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In brief, the FDA methodology employed ""high"" dose experiments on animals and extrapolated the observed rates of certain types of cancer at these elevated doses to the low doses found in human diets. These extrapolations were then used to define a recommended tolerance level of 5 ppm, and proposed reduction to 2 ppm, for fish sold in interstate commerce. Unfortunately, as is shown here, such a procedure is extremely sensitive to the basis for extrapolation. Important elements of the FDA analysis include the following: (i) FDA assumed a particular form of the dose-response model: the one-hit model. Many other models have been proposed and, on balance, appear equally plausible. These models estimate lower risks than does the one-hit model. (ii) FDA calculated 99% upper confidence bounds on these risks and, moreover, emphasized cases of fish eaters who consume greater amounts of PCB-contaminated fish than do 98.5% of the U.S. population. (iii) FDA based PCB ingestion computations on consumption of raw fish, whereas most fish are cooked before eating, and it is known that PCB levels in cooked fish are lower than PCB levels in raw fish. (iv) FDA based estimates of cancer risk on the assumption that PCB levels in fish would be constant over the nominal 70-year human life span used in the FDA ""lifetime risk"" computation. Recent data suggest that PCB levels have been declining in fish (particularly in sport fish) and humans as well. Such trends imply significantly lower cumulative lifetime PCB doses than were assumed in the FDA analysis. (v) FDA assumed that humans and test animals are equally sensitive to PCB ingestion when measured on a parts per million in diet basis. Extrapolations on an equivalent consumption per unit of body weight, thought appropriate by most researchers, result in much lower health risks. In short, when confronted with methodological choices, the FDA consistently selected ""worst case"" or conservative assumptions over other alternatives of at least equal plausibility. This philosophy of choice was explicitly acknowledged by the FDA. What was omitted from the FDA analysis, however, was the possible degree of overstatement of these risks. The results of replicate risk computations using alternative assumptions to examine the possible magnitude of overstatement of health risk are summarized in Table 12. As can be seen, this overstatement could easily account for a discrepancy of several orders of magnitude between actual and calculated risks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",p

Breast feeding and the older infant.,"The possible benefits and disadvantages to the older infant of breast-feeding being continued after the introduction of solid foods are reviewed. The limited evidence from industrialised countries suggests that prolonged partial breast-feeding has little influence on child health and growth. In contrast, in poor areas of the developing world, the continuation of breast-feeding for 1-2 years after the introduction of other foods appears to have several major benefits. These include the supply of nutrients, the delivery of protective, digestive and trophic agents, and extending the period of infertility in the mother. Partial breast-feeding after 6 months is associated with reduced severity of infectious diseases particularly in severely malnourished individuals. There is no evidence that partial breast-feeding plays a causal role in poor growth performance. In poor areas of the developing world, breast-feeding, together with the provision of adequate amounts of other foods, should be encouraged for the first two years of life.",p
"Opioid dependence treatment, including buprenorphine/naloxone.","OBJECTIVE
To review opioid dependence (OD) and its treatment. Pharmacologic treatments, including the use of buprenorphine/naloxone, are presented. Pharmaceutical care functions for outpatient OD treatment are discussed.


DATA SOURCES
Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE and HEALTHSTAR searches (from 1966 to November 2000) and through secondary sources. Tertiary sources were also reviewed regarding general concepts of OD and its treatment.


STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION
Relevant articles were reviewed after identification from published abstracts. Articles were selected based on the objectives for this article. Studies of the treatment of OD with buprenorphine were selected based on the topic (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse reactions) and study design (randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with OD with active/placebo comparisons and/or comparisons of active OD treatments). Articles regarding pharmacists' activities in the treatment and prevention of OD were reviewed for the pharmaceutical care section.


DATA SYNTHESIS
OD is considered a medical disorder with costly adverse health outcomes. Although methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is cost-effective for OD, only about 12% of individuals with OD receive this treatment. Psychological and pharmacologic modalities are used to treat OD, but patients often relapse. Drug therapy includes alpha 2-agonists for withdrawal symptoms, detoxification regimens with or without opioids, opioid antagonists, and opioid replacement including methadone, levomethadyl acetate, and buprenorphine. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 allows for office-based opioid replacement therapies. Sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone can be used in this milieu. Buprenorphine with naloxone is currently under new drug application review with the Food and Drug Administration. Clinical research shows buprenorphine to be equal in effectiveness to methadone, but safer in overdose due to its ceiling effect on respiratory depression. It has lower abuse potential and fewer withdrawal symptoms when discontinued. Naloxone is included to decrease diversion and injection of the tablets. Pharmacists in outpatient settings who are familiar with OD have opportunities to provide pharmaceutical care to patients receiving this treatment. Pharmaceutical care functions for OD include ensuring appropriate drug administration, monitoring adverse effects, alleviating withdrawal symptoms, treating intercurrent illnesses, minimizing diversion, and preventing relapse.


CONCLUSIONS
OD is a critical unmet health problem in the US. Buprenorphine combined with naloxone represents an innovative treatment for OD in outpatient settings. This new treatment has advantages over MMT.",p
Food intake patterns and body mass index in observational studies.,"OBJECTIVE
To review studies of patterns of food intake, as assessed by diet index, factor analysis or cluster analysis, and their associations with body mass index or obesity (BMI/Ob).


DESIGN
Systematic literature review MEDLINE search with crosscheck of references.


STUDIES
Thirty observational studies relating food intake patterns to anthropometric information were identified and reviewed. Food intake patterns were defined using a diet index, factor or cluster analysis in 12, nine and nine studies, respectively. Measures of body mass were made concurrently with the diet assessment in all studies, and only in a few cases were the primary outcomes related to BMI/Ob.


RESULTS
The food intake patterns identified could, in most factor or cluster analysis studies, be categorised as: (a) meat, fatty, sweet or energy dense foods; (b) vegetables, fruit, whole grain and low-fat foods; or (c) by high alcohol consumption. The diet indexes were designed to capture a high diversity and/or food combinations matching the recommendations. The relationships with BMI/Ob were inconsistent-ten studies found that intake patterns, which we categorised as fatty, sweet or energy dense were positively associated with BMI/Ob, while similar patterns in four other studies were negatively associated with BMI. The significant associations between diet index score and BMI/Ob were consistently negative, while the associations between factor scores or cluster membership and BMI/Ob were less clear in terms of food intake pattern. Men and women had similar food intake patterns, but food intake patterns were less often positively associated with BMI/Ob in women. In 11 studies, there were no significant associations between food intake pattern and BMI/Ob.


CONCLUSION
This review showed that no consistent associations could be identified between BMI or Ob and food intake patterns, derived from diet index, factor analysis or cluster analysis. However, the heterogeneity of food intake patterns identified by such analyses and the lack of gold standards for the application of these techniques hampers consistent analysis of a relation between food intake patterns and health.",p
Physical polymer surface modification methods and applications in food packaging polymers.,"Continued innovations in the polymer industry have made polymer surface modification methods a subject of intense research. The importance and necessity of surface modification of plastics are explained, and the advantages of physical surface treatments over the less-sophisticated chemical methods are outlined. Currently available physical surface modification methods for food packaging polymers are reviewed from the food packaging perspective. These physical surface modification methods include flame, corona discharge, UV, gamma-ray, electron beam, ion beam, plasma, and laser treatments. The principle of operation of each method is briefly described, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique are cited. The extent to which each of these methods can produce the specific modifications desired is discussed. Furthermore, the effects of each treatment on barrier, mechanical, and adhesion properties of food packaging polymers are also examined. Finally, an overview of economic aspects of sophisticated surface modification techniques, including ion beam, plasma, and laser treatments, is presented.",p
Mass spectrometric analysis of tetracycline antibiotics in foods.,"We will review recent developments in mass spectrometric analysis of tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) in foods. The mass spectrometric techniques discussed are as follows: the collision-activated decomposition mass-analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry (CAD MIKES), thin-layer chromatography (TLC)- fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry (MS), particle beam (PB) liquid chromatography (LC)-MS, LC-fit FAB MS, thermospray (TSP) LC-MS, atmospheric chemical ionization (APCI) LC-MS and tandem electrospray (ESI) LC-MS. Their advantages and limitations are described in the confirmation of TCs in foods: CAD MIKES can confirm TCs with high sensitivity; however, its practical application is questionable because of uncommon instrumentation. TSP has a problem in reproducibility of the mass spectrum. Although TLC-FAB-MS can be applied to any kind of samples, it cannot be used for the quantitative analysis. LC-frit FAB-MS is a useful technique for the confirmation of TCs in honey, but it cannot be applied to animal tissues because of a lack of sensitivity. PB negative chemical ionization, APCI, and ESI-MS-MS can reliably confirm TCs in foods with good reproducibility.",p
"Eating behavior in humans, characterized by cumulative food intake curves--a review.","Cumulative food intake curves have been obtained by monitoring eating from a plate, placed on a scale built into a table, and connected to a digital computer. They describe and integrate parameters of consumption of an ad lib single course meal, i.e. meal size, meal duration, eating rate, change in eating rate, bite size and bite frequency. It is concluded that they are an adequate tool for analyzing dietary and clinical interventions on meal size, because the cumulative food intake curve parameters: are stable and consistent within subjects; show a clear relationship with the subject characteristics dietary restraint and obesity; show a clear relationship with the physiological parameters satiation, diet-induced thermogenesis and body-temperature near the liver, and with the cognitive parameter: estimating forthcoming ingestion; are sensitive to instructions, clinical and dietary interventions (preloads, palatability, energy density, macronutrient composition), and to a state of negative energy balance. Because of possible compensatory post-prandial effects, it is suggested that assessment of meal size should be part of a 24 h appetite profile and food intake observation.",p
Commercial hospital discharge packs for breastfeeding women.,"BACKGROUND
Exclusive breastfeeding until around six months of age, followed by the introduction of solids with continued breastfeeding, is considered to be the optimal nutritional start for newborn infants.


OBJECTIVES
To determine whether the exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding is affected by giving mothers commercial discharge packs in hospital which contain artificial formula or promotional material for artificial formula. These packs are those which are commonly given to mothers on leaving hospital after giving birth (thus discharge packs).


SEARCH STRATEGY
Comprehensive electronic search of the register of clinical trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group and CINAHL and MEDLINE.


SELECTION CRITERIA
All randomised controlled trials with or without blinding to examine the effects of commercial discharge packs on breastfeeding.


PARTICIPANTS
Consenting postpartum women who initiate breastfeeding while in hospital or immediately upon discharge.


INTERVENTIONS
Commercial discharge packs which contain free samples of infant formula or promotional material versus non commercial discharge packs (specifically those from which free samples of infant formula have been removed or have been replaced with e.g. breast pads) or no pack.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The proportion of women breastfeeding at six weeks and 3 months (13 weeks) postpartum. Other outcomes: Rates of breastfeeding at other fixed time points between 0 and 6 months postpartum.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer.


MAIN RESULTS
Nine randomised controlled trials involving a total of 3730 women were analysed. The studies only included women from North America. The meta-analysis showed that when comparing commercial discharge packs with any of the controls (no intervention, non-commercial pack and combinations of these), exclusive breastfeeding was reduced at all time points in the presence of commercial hospital discharge packs. There was no evidence to support the conjecture that use of hospital discharge packs causes the early termination of non-exclusive breastfeeding. Where the introduction of solid food was measured, giving a commercial pack (with or without formula) reduced the time before solid food was introduced.


REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS
The giving of commercial hospital discharge packs (with or without formula) appears to reduce the number of women exclusively breastfeeding at all times but has no significant effect upon the earlier termination of non-exclusive breastfeeding.",p
Fish flavor.,"This article reviews features of flavor in three groups of fishes and summarizes them as follows: (1) fresh saltwater fish are nearly odorless because they contain a small quantity of volatiles; (2 freshwater fish give off pyrrolidine and earthy-odor compounds, which are responsible for their maturity and surrounding water pollution, and (3) euryhaline fish exhibit a variety of unsaturated carbonyls and alcohols derived from enzymatic and nonenzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PAs). These features are discussed, as are the effects of different enzymatic activities on PA oxidation and the effects of pH on mechanisms of formation of the volatiles. The monotonous volatile constitution of saltwater fish is likely caused by an unknown antioxidation system restraining the fish from oxidizing. The variety of constitution of euryhaline fish, especially that of anadromous fish under spawning conditions, could result from the loss of that system. The thermal environments of heated foods are also reviewed. The basic environment of fish, which allows the formation of flavor compounds, is discussed to confirm the volatiles found in unheated fish.",p
Laetrile: end play around the FDA. A review of legal developments.,"We consider here some of the legal and political background behind today's laetrile controversy. First, we provide a brief historical review of our present food and drug legislation and discuss details of these laws with respect to attempts by laetrile's backers to use the courts in the legalization of this compound. We analyze one case, Rutherford v. United States, that was won in the lower courts by the advocates of laetrile and conclude that the courts may have allowed emotionalism to interfere with the process of rational decision-making. On a larger scale, this emotionalism manifests itself as political pressure that may bring about changes in our food and drug legislation. These changes could loosen restrictions on the effectiveness requirement and result in the sacrifice of consumer protection in favor of making available more drugs, some of them ineffective, from which the patient may choose for treatment.",p
Application of near infrared spectrophotometry to the nondestructive analysis of foods: a review of experimental results.,"The authors are reviewing here the development and the application of the nondestructive spectrophotometric analytical techniques applied to the agricultural commodities. Following a short description of the theoretical bases of this technique, the most significant applications are reviewed leading to the evolution of the first generation of instruments based on such principles. The applications of the specific instruments developed for on-line measurements are summarized. The Grain Quality Analyzers actually marketed and their use in the determination of a wide range of components in foods are described. The experience gained by the research developed using such instruments has generated a new series of computerized instruments allowing for new methodologies and applications that are discussed and reviewed here. The state of the art and the development trends are briefly discussed, particularly referring to the research aimed to the extension of this technique to evaluate different chemical compounds in foods, to use as quality indices for agronomic, processing, and marketing purposes.",p
Determination of vitamin D in foods: a review.,"Determining vitamin D content in foods is difficult because in natural foods of highest vitamin D activity, and even in vitamin D-fortified foods, only small quantities are present, and many other compounds are extracted along with vitamin D that cause difficulties in purifying the extract or in the spectrophotometry or colorimetry that follows. Several physicochemical methods--such as spectrophotometric, colorimetric, thin-layer chromatographic, adsorption, partition, gas-liquid, and high-performance column chromatographic--have been tried for assay foods for vitamin D, but none of them have been accepted for official or routine use; they are time consuming and expensive, or lack the required sensitivity, precision, or accuracy. Curative biological assays, based on degree of healing of a leg bone of rats previously made rachitic, is the generally accepted method to determine vitamin D content of foods. However, that method also requires too much time and is expensive. The recently developed high-performance liquid chromatographic method may offer the most for establishing a satisfactory physicochemical method for determining vitamin D in foods. Many of the difficulties and problems in assaying foods for vitamin D are discussed.",p
"Dietary fats, teas, dairy, and nuts: potential functional foods for weight control?","Functional foods are similar to conventional foods in appearance, but they have benefits that extend beyond their basic nutritional properties. For example, functional foods have been studied for the prevention of osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. They have yet to be related to the prevention of obesity, although obesity is one of the major health problems today. The inclusion of foods or the replacement of habitual foods with others that may enhance energy expenditure (EE) or improve satiety may be a practical way to maintain a stable body weight or assist in achieving weight loss; such foods may act as functional foods in body weight control. Some foods that might be classified as functional foods for weight control because of their effects on EE and appetite-including medium-chain triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, tea, milk, and nuts-are reviewed here. Only human studies reporting EE, appetite, or body weight are discussed. When studies of whole food items are unavailable, studies of nutraceuticals, the capsular equivalents of functional foods, are reviewed. To date, dietary fats seem to be most promising and have been the most extensively studied for their effects on body weight control. However, the weight loss observed is small and should be considered mostly as a measure to prevent weight gain. Carefully conducted clinical studies are needed to firmly ascertain the effect of tea, milk, and nuts on body weight maintenance, to assess their potential to assist in weight-loss efforts, and to ascertain dose-response relations and mechanisms of action for the 4 food types examined.",p
A review of food provision to a renal ward and the proposed appointment of feeding assistants.,"Malnutrition among renal patients has been widely documented and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Advances in dialysis technology and transplantation have helped to increase patient long-term survival, and as more elderly patients commence dialysis programs, the problem of malnutrition is escalating. Hospitalized renal patients are at a greater risk, as dietary intakes may be reduced for a number of reasons. A multidisciplinary team decided to review the existing cook-chill plated meal system and all food provision to the renal ward. The aim of this review was to assess the nutritional intake of renal inpatients and to gauge patients' and relatives' attitudes towards hospital food provision. From these results, we hoped to go on and implement some changes to help improve the situation. Results showed that 34% of the patients ate half or less of the hospital food provided, and 80% of patients surveyed relied on food brought in by relatives and friends. Actual dietary intakes were compared to Dietary Reference Values (DRVs; Department of Health [DoH], UK, 1995). One hundred percent of the patients did not achieve the DRVs for energy, iron, potassium, zinc, folate, B6, and riboflavin. Sixty-six percent of the patients did not achieve the DRV for protein. These results were discussed by the multidisciplinary group, and it was decided to trial a cook-chill bulk trolley to replace the existing plated meal system. Unfortunately, to implement a bulk trolley system, the ward needs someone to serve the food. This could be the job of a ""feeding assistant"" or ""ward hostess."" A bid has been put forward to the hospital Trust Board to obtain funding for these ""feeding assistants, "" and the bulk trolley can be acquired from existing funds. It is hoped that the creation of these new posts will go some of the way towards improving the patients' dietary intake while in the hospital.",p
Changes in food habits in families with a newly diagnosed child with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"Dietary recommendations for children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) are in line with the recommendations for the general population and applicable to the whole family. We review what is known about the food habits of non-diabetic family members and present original data on dietary changes in families with a child with DM. Some studies suggest that family members eat mostly the same food as the affected child. In a Finnish study of siblings of children with DM, favourable changes were observed after diagnosis in the type of milk and fat used. In a study of young children with DM, family members increased their consumption of skim milk, low-fat cheese and low-fat cold meat cuts. The consumption frequencies of fruit and vegetables increased. In conclusion, family members of a child with DM are willing to change their food habits towards the recommended diet. Dietary advice should be directed to the whole family from the very beginning.",p
Physical activity and regulation of food intake: current evidence.,"OBJECTIVE
The evidence was reviewed on how physical activity could influence the regulation of food intake by either adjusting the sensitivity of appetite control mechanisms or by generating an energy deficit that could adjust the drive to eat.


DESIGN
Interventionist and correlational studies that had a significant influence on the relationship between physical activity and food intake were reviewed. Interventionist studies involve a deliberate imposition of physical activity with subsequent monitoring of the eating response. Correlational studies make use of naturally occurring differences in the levels of physical activity (between and within subjects) with simultaneous assessment of energy expenditure and intake.


SUBJECTS
Studies using lean, overweight, and obese men and women were included.


RESULTS
Only 19% of interventionist studies report an increase in energy intake after exercise; 65% show no change and 16% show a decrease in appetite. Of the correlational studies, approximately half show no relationship between energy expenditure and intake. These data indicate a rather loose coupling between energy expenditure and intake. A common sense view is that exercise is futile as a form of weight control because the energy deficit drives a compensatory increase in food intake. However, evidence shows that this is not generally true. One positive aspect of this is that raising energy expenditure through physical activity (or maintaining an active life style) can cause weight loss or prevent weight gain. A negative feature is that when people become sedentary after a period of high activity, food intake is not ""down-regulated"" to balance a reduced energy expenditure.


CONCLUSION
Evidence suggests that a high level of physical activity can aid weight control either by improving the matching of food intake to energy expenditure (regulation) or by raising expenditure so that it is difficult for people to eat themselves into a positive energy balance.",p
