# Re-Search: An Academic Search Engine

Re-Search is an academic search engine made as a coursework for Edinburgh University's Text Technologies for Data Science course. It allows you to search for publicly available datasets and research papers using three different ranking algorithms - TF-IDF, BM25, and ScaNN. It also supports author search (wherever the datapoint allows it), phrase search, and proximity search along with its default search type.
